--> Rootkits to get into kernel levels and infect the boot processes itself

This makes securing the Boot process very important.

1. Secure Boot
2. Trusted Boot
3. Measured Boot

--> These 3 steps are called Chain of trust

# Hardware Root of Trust

TPM (Trusted Platform Module)
HSM (Hardware Security Module)

Hardware cannot be changed easily.


# TPM 

A piece of hardware that is s specification for cryptographic functions

--> Cryptographic Generator (Rand num gen, key gen)
--> Persistent memory fir unique key values burnt in during protection\
\
--> All info in the TPM is password protected and cannot be brute forced

TPM provides the hardware sec

# UEFI BIOS Secure Boot

TPM provides hardware security and our BIOS provides the software security

Any device with a UEFI bios will be able to use a secure boot

Sec measures built into the bios:

1. Manufacturer's publickey is included in the BIOS
2. Digital Signature of a BIOS update is always checks (prevents insecure bios updates)
3. prevents unauthorized writes

Secxure boot also verifies the Bootloader and checks if the bootloader is signed with a secure ceritificate (checks it digital dignature)


# Trusted Boot

Now the verified BOOTLOADER verifies the signature of the OS Kernel.
Corrupted Kernels halt the boot process. 

The kernel then verifies the other startup components --> Boot drivers/ startup files

Before launching drivers ELAM (Early Launch AntiMalware) starts, which chekcs every driver to see if it is trusted. If the digital sig verification fails/ is untrusted, then the driver won't load

# Measured Boot

Donw after the boot by humans to check if anything has been changed in the OS
Easy for one ersonal system, but in large orgs other stpes must be taken

UEFI stores the hashse of firmwares, boot drivers, everything else loaded during the secure boot and trusted boot process in the TPM 

Remote attestation occurs by sysadmins
