Physical/ logical/ virtual segmentation

App segmentation --> Highperformance functions use higher bandwidth

# Physical segmentation
have different devices. (aka Air gap)

# Logical Seperation

VLANs --> Oneswitch segmentedlogically, works entirely asphyscical seperation

# Screened Subnet

(DMZ) --> demilitarized zone

# East-west traffic

In a daa center, it is common to refer to traffic flows with directions. 

East-west traffic is within the devices in the same data centre (very fast data flow).

# North-south traffic 
inbound or outbound traffic (more sec required)


# Zero Trust

Many networksare relatively open to the inside. In the past, onceyou breached the firewall, there werefew sec controls inside.

Zero trust is an approach that covers every device, every person.
