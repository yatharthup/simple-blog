# Edge control vs Access Control

Access control doesn't care about where you are in the network

Edge controls if you are on the outisde of a network

Access control rules can be changed drastically and suddenly

# Posture Assessment
Bring-your-own-device environments are especially vuln

Provide own devices, or if not possible, run extensive security checks on the device/ health checks

we can intallPersistent Agents (software agents that run everytime the device connects to the network)

Dissolvable Agents, checks once

Agentless NAC --> Integrated into the OS (Example: Active Directory on windows) // Thes checks cannot be  scheduled though, hence another software might be required


> *DO NOT ALLOW DEVICES THAT FAIL THE CHECKS*
