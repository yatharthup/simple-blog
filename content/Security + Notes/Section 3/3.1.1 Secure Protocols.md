# Voice/ Video

#### RTP 
Rela time transoprt protocol.

## SRTP --> Secure RTP

It uses AES encryption

Has Authentication / Intergrity and replay protection
Using HMAC --> Hash bsed message authenticationSHA1


# Time Synchronization

## Classic NTP

Network time protocol

Around since beofre 1985. 
Exploited as amplifiers in DDoS attacks. Classic NTP did NOT have any sec measures built in

--> NTPsec : Secure version began dev in 2015

# Email

## S/MIME

Secure Multipurpose internet mail extensions

requires a public private key
Public key encryption / Digital signing of mail content
Requires a PKI (public key infra)/ similar org


## Sec POP and Sec IMAP

--> Include a STARTTLS externsion to encrypt POP3 with SSL
--> Or use IMAP with SSL

## SSL/TLS

If email is browser based (gmail) always encrypt with SSL

# Web 

## SSL/TLS
sec sockets layer/ transport layter sec

## HTTPS

HTTP sec --> HTTP over TLS

Public private key model is used

Symmetric session key is transferred over the network using asymmetric encryption first

Backbone for most of the internet


## IPSec
Internet PRotocol Security. An ecrypted tunnel

Comm b/w 2 locations on the internet in a secure form.

Security for OSI layer 3. --> Authentication and ecryption for every packet


Includes packet signing for integrity and anti replay.
Encryption for confidentiality

IPsec is very standardised, many manfacturers use this standard.

### Implementing IPsec

2 core IPsec protocols:

1. Authentication Header
2. ESP (Encapsulation Security Payload) --> Provides the encyrption


# File transfer

## FTPS

FTP over SSL
File transfer protocol Secure
Very different from SFTP
## SFTP

SSH File Transfer Protocol

SSH is used to provide the ecryption

Provides File system functionality

Remote file removal is possible using this

# LDAP

Lightweight Directory Access Protocol

Used for reading and writing Directories over an IP network

x.500 specification by ITU (international telecommunications union)

DAP --> Ran on the OSI protocol stack
LDAP --> uses TCP/IP

Ex: Windows Active Dorectory / Aplle OpenDorectory/ OpenLDAP


# LDAPS

Non standard secure implementation of LDAP over SSL

SASL --> Simple Authentication and Security Layer
--> A framework that many idff protocols can use. LDAP does so too
--> Provides security using Kerberos or client cert 

# REmote Access

# SSH
Secure Shell
Encrypted Terminal Comm

Replaces Telnet --> no encyption

# DNS

Original DNS had no security in its original design
Allowed attackers to change info to and from DNS servers, effectively allowing redirection.

## DNSSEC
--> Domain Name Systems Security Extensions
--> Origin authentication
-->Data integrity implemented

Validates DNS responses

Uses Public Key cryptography

DNS records are signed with a trusted thrid party
Signed records are published in the DNS server

# Routing and Switching

## SSH 

## SNMP 
Simple Network Management PRotocol for querying our routers and network devices.

Version 3 SNMPv3 is the secure version which follows the CIA triad. Added Encryption (confidentiality)

## HTTPS
Used when using a browser top query the device

# Network Address Allocation


## DHCP
Dynamic Host Configuration PRotocol 

Autpomatically assigns IP addr to devices on the network 

No secure version of DHCP

### However, additional controls OUTSIDE odf the protocol itself are implemented.

ex:
In Active Directory, DHCP servers must be authorised (prevention from RogueDHCP servers)
DHCP distribution is only allowed from verified soruces. (DHCP snooping)

## DHCP client DoS

Stravation Attack

Switcxhes can be configured to limit the number of MAC addr per interface

--> Disable an interface when multiple MAC addr are seen
