# Site to Site VPNs

Many site tosite VPNs are configured using L2TP --> Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol
Connecting sites over a layer 3 network as if they were connected at layer 2

Comonly used with IPsec

# IPsec
Auth and Encryption over a Layer 3 network

AH + ESP

2 ways to send encrypteddata over  IPsec

1. Transportmode--> data is encrypted
2. Tunnel mode --> headers + data are encrypted
