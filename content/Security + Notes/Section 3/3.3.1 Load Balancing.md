A technique to distribute traffic load to multiple servers / invisible to the end user.

Large scale implementations

High fault tolerance. Sever outages have no effect.

# Load Balancers

DEvices that can help configure load balancing, offer cacheing services and TCP and SSL offload from the srevers themselves. 

Can prioritize certain apps, Quality of Service.


# Scheduling

1. Round Robin. (nth person is sent to a server)
2. Weighted round robin. (one server recieves more load)
3. Dynamic Round Robin (next person goes tothe lowest load server)
4. Active/ACtive server load balancing

# Affinity

Similar to cookies in a way (for personal understanding, not tehnically)

# Active / PAssive load balancing

When an active Server fails, a server on standby (passive) turns itself on and accepts the load
