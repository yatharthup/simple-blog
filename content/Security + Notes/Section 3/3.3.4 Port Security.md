Physical switchport security for this discussion.


Some challenges are:
# Broadcasts
PAckets sent to everyone onthe netwprk at once

Too many broadcasts on the network can eat bandwidth

Rotuing updates/ ARP requests are broadcasts as well

Broadcasts have domains. 

Broadcasts are NOT used in IPV6 (they have multicasts)

Switches can have built in functionality to control vbrodacastsa, multi and unicasts

# Loop connections

IEEE 802.1D standard in 1990 prevents loops on layer 2 (physical) networks.

AKA : STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
![[Pasted image 20240624214212.png]]

BP is a port that has been administratively disabled to prevent loops 

Ifcertain interfaces fail, STP goes into Convergence modes, and removes certain blocks to allow communications.

# BPDU guard
Bridge PRotocol Data unit

Primary protocol used by STP.

So, if you connect a swtich into a port desginated for an endpoint device, it will send a BPDU frame, which the other switch will detect and disable the device, as workstations don't send BPDU frames 

# DHCP snooping

Dynamic Host Config protocol

The  switcxh itself is a dhcp firewall

# MAC filtering

Allow or disallow traffic based on MAC addr

More of an admin tool instead of a Sec control
