The cloud allows elasticity and extreme computing power on demand. It also allows applications to scale, and better planning.


# Thin Client

Almost Everything is ran on the cloud. Applications run on the remote server.

Our client only provides some very basic capabilities and just enough computing power to connect to the cloud desktop. 

This is reffered to as a VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure.)

DaaS (Desktop as a service)

--> Minimal OS on the client means minimal system requirements.
--> However, since everything happens over the network, the network requirements of such devices are high.


# Virtualisation

Many different OS running on the same hardware.

![[Pasted image 20240620235538.png]]

Virtualisation is relatively expensive.

# Application Containerisation

![[Pasted image 20240620235643.png]]

Prevents having to allocate different resources for each OS instance.

A relatively light way to deploy an application.

# Monolithic Architecture

Monolithic Application

--> One big app that does everything
--> Built on a single codebase

Everything is self contained in the app.
1. User interface
2. Business logic
3. Data I/O
4. All decision making is in the same app

 ![[Pasted image 20240621000046.png]]

### Problems:
1. Very large codebase makes it harder to manage
2. The entire codebase has to changed when making updates/upgrades. The entire codebase has to be replaced

# This is where the Microservices architecture comes in.

The Monolithic codebase is broken into different services, and then for each API there is a different gateway. Think of it as having small mosules now, that come together to make the entire app. When an update is required, that singular module is changed, and everything else remains the same.

// There might be different Databases for each microservice or one shared database.

This segmentation allows for better security controls over data AND also allows the app to keep working even if a few parts (microservices) are not operational for some reason.

--> Resilient
-->Scalable


# Serverless Architecture

FaaS 
Function as a aservice

Apps are separated into individual and autonomous functions.
This removes the OS from the equation.

>Serverless architecture is a cloud computing model where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. In a serverless setup, the developer focuses solely on writing code without having to manage the infrastructure required to run it.

Key characteristics of serverless architecture include:

1. **Event-driven**: Functions (often called serverless functions or just functions) are triggered by events such as HTTP requests, database updates, file uploads, etc. These events automatically invoke the corresponding function without the developer needing to manage the invocation.
    
2. **Scaling**: Serverless platforms automatically scale the number of function instances up or down based on the number of incoming requests or events. This allows applications to handle varying loads without manual intervention.
    
3. **Pay-per-use pricing**: Users are charged based on the actual amount of resources consumed by their functions, rather than paying for a fixed amount of server capacity. This can lead to cost savings, especially for applications with irregular or unpredictable usage patterns.
    
4. **Statelessness**: Functions are typically designed to be stateless, meaning they should not rely on previous invocations or store state locally. Any necessary state is usually managed externally (e.g., in a database or object storage service).
    
5. **Managed services**: Serverless architectures often leverage managed services for tasks such as databases, authentication, and messaging. This reduces the operational overhead for developers, allowing them to focus more on business logic.
    
6. **Rapid deployment**: Deploying updates or new functions in a serverless environment is usually faster compared to traditional server-based architectures, as there's no need to provision servers or manage middleware.
    

Serverless does not mean there are no servers involved; rather, the cloud provider manages the servers, operating systems, and runtime environments, allowing developers to concentrate on writing code and deploying services more efficiently.

Popular serverless platforms include AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, and others, each offering similar fundamental concepts but with variations in features and integrations.


FaaS is a subset of Serverless Architecture, but commonly used synonymously.

# Transit Gateways

Common for orgs to build cloud based services for ONLY internal use, that are running at a third party cloud based service provider.


#### Virtual Private Clouds. --> Different services run in different instances of virtual private clouds.

It is common to create many different application clouds (VPCs)

A Transit Gateway is what connects (provides access) a client to the correct VPC with the relevant app resources.

# Resource Policies

Assigning permissions to cloud resources, to secure Cloud Base app data and the individual apps themselves.

Ex: Allow access to an API gateway from a particular IP addr range only.
Explicitly list users (create resource userlist)

# Service Integration

Some app instances might run on Azure, some on AWS some on Google Cloud etc --> Multisourcing

SIAM --> Consolidates the view from multisourcing into a single interface
//Service Integration and Management

Since every Cloud service provider works differently, SIAM helps to integrate these diverse provider requirements into one place for the org as a unified view, which makes much easier to manage these applications.
