# IaaS / HaaS
Infrastructure as a Service or Hardware as a Service model.

A cloud service provider gives the org a system with computing power/ storage resources and networking capabilities.

The org is still responsible for the softwares(OS/Apps/Programs) running on those systems and for their security.

The data is in the data centre physically, but most of the control over it is retained by the organisation.

Ex: Web server Providers 


# SaaS
Software as a Service 

On demand software that the org simply logs into and uses.

Comes pre configured for the most part, and minimal effort is required on the organisation's part.

Allows central management of data and applications. The SaaS provider is responsible for the application and its management.

ex: Gmail , that offers a whole system for handling emails.

# PaaS

Platform as a Service.

A middle ground b/w HaaS and SaaS 

The service provider provides the infrastructure, the OS and virtualisation capabilities and the organisation is then responsible for the app development and maintenance. 

Again, however, third party (service providers') cybersec professionals are maintaing the data and securing it for the org. This on the flipside also means that the org does NOT have direct control of their own data.

Think of this as making an app from the modular blocks given to you instead of writing the apps from scratch.
Ex: Salesforce.com
Like Wix.com

# XaaS

Anything as a Service

A broad descriptor that covers any service that is provided over the cloud.

Flexible consumption model (no large upfront costs or ongoing licensing)

Any IT function can be changed into a service.
