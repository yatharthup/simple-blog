# Cloud Computing

Gives an organisation instant access to massive computing and storage capabilities.

--> Fast implementation
--> Smaller startup costs via pay-as-you-go

### Problems with cloud computing

1. Latency if the cloud is physically very far away (another continent)
2. Limited bandwidth b/w the cloud and the org
3. Difficult to protect the data
4. Requires internet/ network connectivity to use the applications


# Edge Computing

There are over 30 billion IoT devices.

Most of the computation over the data gathered via these devices is done ON THE DEVICES THEMSELVES. 

This means that it is close to the user. 

These devices are called Edge Servers

# Fog Computing

Cloud + IoT

Computation is distributed.

Some data is processed on the device itself, some data is sent and processed in the cloud.

--> Long term data analysis on the Cloud

--> Short term/Private data analysis on the device itself.
