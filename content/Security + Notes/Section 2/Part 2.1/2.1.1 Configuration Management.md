1. Things keep changing //OS, patches, app updates, network mods, new app instances , etc
2. Identify and document hardware and software settings (helps tolook quickly for configurations for these systems when changes occur. This helps to maintain the proper security of these machines)
3. Good documentation helps to rebuild the entire system in case of disasters.


# Diagrams

1. Network Diagrams
		Document the physical wiring and device
2. Physical Data Centre layout
		Can include physical rack locations
3. Device Diagrams // Individual cabling in details

# Baseline Configuration

> A Baseline Configuration refers to a standardized set of security settings or configurations that are recommended and implemented across all systems within an organization. The primary purpose of establishing a Baseline Configuration is to ensure consistency and to reduce the attack surface by minimizing unnecessary services, ports, and configurations that could potentially be exploited by attackers. --> chatGPT


Integrity measurements checks should be ran periodically to check if all the details in the documentation are matched in the real world systems. 

If a deviation is found from these previously created documentation/ baseline configs, then it must be properly understood and measures should be taken to ensure it matches the baseline again.

# Standard Naming Conventions

Create a standard for naming that can be easily understood by everyone involved. 

Helps with being clear and concise about operations and instructions.

Ex:
### Devices
Asset names and numbers
Computer names / Location of the system
Serial Number of the system

### Network Equipment
Port Labelling
Again, Device Labelling (Switches and Router device names, and port and services mentioned on them)
Patch Panel numbers

### Domain Configs
Usernames/Email addresses follow a convention

//Example of a well labelled data centre switch rack

# IP Schema 

Standardisations for IP addr in an org

Helps in determining what addresses are used in which location.

--> Consistent addr for IPs
--> Helps avoid duplicate IPs

### Locations 
1. Number of Subnets
2. hosts per subnets

### IP Ranges

Different IP ranges for different subnets(and those locations then subnet form there)

Different Sites will have diff subnets 
10.1.x.x /24 , 10.2.x.x / 24 etc

### Reserve IPs in a subnet for a specific device type

.1 --> Default gateway

.x --> printer

.y --> camera 


etc
