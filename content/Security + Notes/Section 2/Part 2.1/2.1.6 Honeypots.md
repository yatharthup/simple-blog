Sites intentionally set up with vuln to attract threat actors, and then collect information about their operations.
It also directs attention away from the actual sites of the org and keeps them hidden.

Works best when the "attacker" is a machine (usually the case).

Example: Kippo / Google Hack Honeypot/ Wordpot

Should accurately replicate real world scenarios

#### Honeyfiles --> Attractive files in the honeypot. (ex: passwords.txt)

# Fake telemetry

Since a lot of honeypot monitoring is automated, and trained over machine learning, an attacker might send data over to the algorithm in a way that it learns to recognise malicious software as benign. Then the attacker can send this whenever they want without being detected.

Fake telemetry refers to falsified or misleading data that is transmitted or reported from telemetry systems. Telemetry, in general, involves the automated measurement and transmission of data from remote or inaccessible sources to receiving equipment for monitoring and analysis. This data is crucial for making informed decisions in various fields such as aerospace, automotive engineering, healthcare, and more.

However, in some contexts, fake telemetry can be deliberately injected into these systems for various reasons:

1. **Testing and Development**: During the testing phase of telemetry systems, developers might inject fake telemetry to simulate different scenarios or stress conditions without having to physically replicate them. This helps in assessing how the system responds under various circumstances.
    
2. **Security Testing**: Ethical hackers and security professionals sometimes use fake telemetry to test the resilience of systems against potential attacks or intrusions. By injecting fake data, they can check how well the system detects anomalies or unauthorized access attempts.
    
3. **Demonstrations and Training**: In educational or promotional contexts, fake telemetry might be used to demonstrate the capabilities of a system without needing actual data. This can be useful in training sessions or marketing presentations.
    
4. **Malicious Intent**: In more concerning scenarios, fake telemetry can be introduced with malicious intent. For example, in cybersecurity attacks, adversaries might inject false data to mislead monitoring systems or to cover up their actions.
    

Detecting fake telemetry is crucial in ensuring the reliability and security of telemetry systems. Advanced monitoring techniques, anomaly detection algorithms, and rigorous data validation processes are often employed to identify and filter out fake or erroneous data from genuine telemetry streams.

# DNS Sinkhole

A DNS that hands out *incorrect* IP addr.

Maliciously, it can be an attacker changing a legit website's IP.

However, this can also be used (and is used) by the good people to redirect traffic headed to known malicious domains to benign ones. 

The analysts then also know that theses devices that tried to visit these malicious services are infected. Then help them if they are a part of our org. The security team can clean those devices before the infection spreads.

This is a function that is usually integrated in IPS/ new gen firewalls.
