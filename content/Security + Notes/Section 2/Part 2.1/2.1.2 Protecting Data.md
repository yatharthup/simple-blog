Protecting an org's data is one of our chief tasks.

A challenge with protecting data is that it is everywhere and in different locations, formats and on different devices.

Some general ways are:
1. encrypting the data
2. Have sec policies within the org
3. Having data permissions (Access Controls)


# Data Sovereignty

> Data that resides in a certain country is subject to the data laws of that country.

Ex: GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) law of The EU  requires data collected on EU citizens to be stored in the EU itself.

# Data Masking

Another way of protecting data, by obfuscating it.

Ex: Using Band card numbers in receipts.

![[data_masking_example.png]]

--> Helps  protect PII.

--> However the full bank card number might be stored on other servers within the organisation. However, we don't have the rights to view it in full, so any time we print it, it comes obfuscated.
(Controlling the view of the data based on permissions)

Many diff techniques can be used for data ofuscation:
1. Encryption
2. Substituting
3. Shuffling
4. Masking Out 


# Data Encryption

Another way of protecting the data (Widely used)

##### Confusion

The concept of Confusion is vital to encryption

> Confusion:
	The Encrypted information must be  VERY different from the original plaintext info. 

Ex : Using PGP to encrypt a message: 

![[PGP_encyp_example.png]]

##### Diffusion

The concept of Diffusion is also necessary for good encryption:

> Diffusion
> 		If just one small part /bit of the plaintext is changed, ciphertext must be drastically altered.

# Data at Rest

Data on a storage device not being accessed.

SSD/ Hard Disks/ Pendrives

To protect Data-at-rest:
1. Encrypt the Data // Whole disk encryption/DB encryption/ File or folder level encryption
2. Apply Access Permissions on the Data // Access control lists so that only authorised users can access the data


# Data in Transit / data in motion

Data being transmitted over networks

Protecting Data in transit:
1. Encryption // TLS/SSL (Transport Layer sec), IPsec (Internet Protocol Sec)
2. Firewalls/ IPS


# Data in Use

Data on our active systems. 

In the RAM/ ROM/ Caches/ CPU registers of the systems.

This data is almost always decrypted (otherwise working with it would not be possible)
This makes it a very attractive point for attackers as they can simply pick the data out of the RAM.

Ex: Target Breach November 2013


# Tokenisation 

> Replace sensitive data with a non sensitive plcaeholder.

Another way to protect data in which we show a completely different kind of data instead of what was present there (the actual data).

Ex: SSN 266-12-1112 becomes 691-61-8539

We store the SSN in our database as this token, so even if the DB is breached, no one will be able to misuse this PII, as it makes no actual sense.

Commonly Used with Credit card info. 

*This is NOT hashing/encryption*

# IRM 
Information Rights Management

Ex: Copying from certain PDFs.

Used to restrict data access to unauthorised persons.

Goal is to limit the scope of what a user can do with the info. 

Use case: An employee's system is hacked, but the attacker can not edit more sensitive files shared with this employee because their own permissions to this are restricted to , say, read-only.
