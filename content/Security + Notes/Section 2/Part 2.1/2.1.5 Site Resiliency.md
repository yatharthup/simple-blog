# Disaster Recovery Site

### Hot site

An exact replica of the original location

The organisation effectively buys 2 of everything, and installs one in this mirror site

Applications and Softwares are constantly updated (generally automatically) to stay in harmony with the original site

Switching to this from the original site is a streamlined process.

### Cold Site 

Is effectively the opposite of a hot site, and is just a room/ building infrastructure with racks and NO equipment / Data in place.

No people, or data

Both people and data have to be brought here

### Warm sites 

In the middle of a Hot and Cold Site 

Usually, this is what a Disaster Recovery location for most organisations looks like.
