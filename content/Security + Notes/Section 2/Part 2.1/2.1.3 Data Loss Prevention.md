We store a lot of different kinds of data in a lot of different kinds of places in our systems.

We need Data Loss Prevention Systems that are smart and can look into many different locations for data and protect our systems.

### Endpoint DLP Systems

--> Reside on our systems 
--> Examine everything on the RAM (data in use)

DLP technologies on the network examine everything goes across the network. (data in transit)

DLP on servers (data at rest)

###### In some cases DLPs can be designed to block access to different types of hardware.

Example: USB blocking

Ex: November 2008 US department of Defence  agent.btz worm

### Cloud Based DLP

Resides on the cloud

1. Block custom defined data strings
2. Manage URL access --> Prevent file transfers to cloud storage
3. Block viruses/malwares traversing the networks

#  DLP on Email Systems

Email continues to be the most critical  risk vector

DLP systems check both inbound and outbound emails 

Filter inbound emails by blocking keywords / Quarantining Emails / Identifying imposters 

Outbound filtering --> Fake wire transfers, employee info
