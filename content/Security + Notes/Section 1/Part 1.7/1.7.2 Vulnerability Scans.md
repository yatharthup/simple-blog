Usually these are minimally invasive (unlike pentests)

> Tries to determine from the outside if there is a *potential* to gain access to a system.

Vuln scans test both from the outside and the inside.
Get as much information as possible , and separate the important part from the fluff later.

# Some common vuln scans:

1. Port Scan
		example, having a Telnet port open on a machine. Telnet  is inherently unencrypted and this makes it a vuln point
2. Vuln scanners
		Use many different techniques to identify vuln/potential vuln. However in contrast to Pentests, these do NOT try to take advantage of the found vuln.

// One common approach to Scanning Vuln is to scan as a user who doesn't have access to the network. Aka , a non-credentialed scan.

// Another approach is to run the scan as an insider threat - someone who is in the network. Aka, a credentialed scan. Tests how much of a vuln might be present if the attacker was someone with a little bit of access to these systems.

--> Be careful and authorised when performing a vuln scan. Even though it is largely non intrusive, there have been cases where the software finds a bug, which in turn causes the systems to become unavailable for service.

# Vuln research

Vuln found from scanners can be cross referenced online. 

Similar sources  are the CVE databases/ NVD database. (basically, threat research sources)

Sometimes, additional research might be required since not every vuln found would *directly* relate to a SVE.


# Dealing with false positives

Sometimes, vuln scanners will identify a vuln that actually DNE on that device.
Such false positives can be dismissed.

However, False positives are NOT to be confused with low severity vuln, as they are not something to casually dismiss entirely.

False negatives are much worse than False positives, that is, a vuln EXISTS on a system but was unidentified by the scanner.

To prevent False positives and Negatives, one way to keep the scanning databases updated.

If possible, work with the vuln detection scanner org to create highly relevant and fine tunesa databases for your system env.

# Methods to look for Vuln without using a formal Vuln Scanner

1. Look for configuration issues.
		Misconfigurations are easy to do, and common, and one unlocked window can have grave security implications.

2. Check Workstations and services running on them
3. Check access controls and permissions on Servers
4. Audit the security devices (firewalls, proxies, authentication Options) themselves, regularly.
