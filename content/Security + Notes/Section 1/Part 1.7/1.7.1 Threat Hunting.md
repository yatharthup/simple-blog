One problem is that intelligence data is reactive, and we can't see the attack until it happens.

What we can do then, is to speed up the reaction time and use constant cutting-edge strategies.

# Intelligence Fusion

Usually there is an overwhelming amount of data from very different sources. Often these might even be in different data types, and from different teams.

The course of action here is, then, to fuse the security data together with big data analytics, to analyse large  and diverse datasets, and to zero in on the interesting points and correlations.

# Fusing the Data

1. Collection of data. //Logs, sensors, IDS, Network info
2. External source info //threat feeds, gov orgs, social media
3. Correlate with big data analytics, start performing predictive mathematical analysis.
4. Apply relevant measures based on the insights gained.

# Cybersecurity Manoeuvres

1. Setting firewalls
2. Blocking IP addresses 
3. Deleting Malicious softwares (identified from the phases above)
4. Using automated manoeuvres to deploy instantaneously after fusion intelligence reaches a conclusion
5. be open to adaptation acc to changing tech
