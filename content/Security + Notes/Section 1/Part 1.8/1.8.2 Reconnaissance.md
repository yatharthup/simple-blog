Info gathering about the systems before a Pentest/Attack

1. Gathering a digital footprint and learning everything about the systems that we can
2. Understanding the security posture (firewalls, sec configurations. networks etc)
3. Minimize the attack area and  focus on key systems 
4. Create a Network map (identify routers/ networks/ IP addr of devices etc)

# Passive Footprinting
Learning from sources that are out in the open.
The victim does NOT know that someone is gathering intelligence actively.

Ex: Social Media , Corporate Website, Online forums/Reddit, Social Eng by directly calling the org, Dumpster Diving , Interactions of other business org with this victim

#### OSINT
OSINT is also a part of passive footprinting.

Automated Gathering via tools

#### Wardriving / Warflying 

Combine Wifi Monitoring and a GPS

1. Search for networks from a car/ plane /drone (pineapple routers on a drone)
2. Huge intel in a short amount of time

Tools like : Kismet/ inSSIder/ Wigle.net (Wireless Geographic Logging Engine)

# Active Footprinting

Actively trying the "doors"

Our activity will be visible on network logs as traffic

1. Ping scans/ Port scans / DNS queries
2. OS Scans/ OS fingerprinting 
3. Service Scans/ Version Scans

Tools like Nmap
