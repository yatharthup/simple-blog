The attacker breaks the cryptography itself. 

The problems in the implementation of the cryptography can allow the attackers to access the data.

# Birthday Attack

Is an issue of probability.

In the digital analogue to this, this is a hash collision.
Same hash value for 2 entirely different plaintexts

If a hash collision is found through bruteforce.

Collisions are bad since hashes are supposed to be unique.

MD5 collisions were found in 1996

# Downgrade attack

When 2 devices comm/connect to each other, there is some transfer of info that agrees  upon what encryption/protocols are to be followed.

If somehow the attacker can influence this and downgrade the comm encryption to a weaker one, they can then intercept and decrypt the traffic easily

2014 TLS vuln is an example [POODLE]

Forced clients to fall back to SSL 3.0 (which has significant cryptographic vuln)
