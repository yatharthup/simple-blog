Often, some of an org's/person/s most valuable possession is their data. Ransomware and crypto-malware target this very resource and use it as  leverage for extortion from the victim.

# Ransomware

Often in the earlier days, ransomware was coupled with hoaxes.

Malware claiming to be government orgs/ law enforcement and locking files, requiring the end user to "pay a fine" to re-open / access the files back.

However, in the older versions of ransomware, simply removing the program was enough to mitigate the issue.

The attackers realised that the hoax simply wasn't serious enough to warrant a payment.
Which in turn led to crypto-malware.

# Crypto-malware

A newer generation of ransomware

Encrypts all of the victim machines information using cryptographic algorithms, and the only way to decrypt it is to have the proper key, which, obviously, the attacker is willing to reveal  only if a certain amount has been paid.

# Protection against Ransomware

1. A backup (offline, isolated  from your current machine)
2. Keep sec patches up to date and installed
3. Latest antivirus/antimalware
