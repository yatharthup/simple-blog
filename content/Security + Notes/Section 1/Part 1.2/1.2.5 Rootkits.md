Originally a UNIX technique

Instead of modifying app files, rootkits modify kernel files (the foundational/core system files of the OS)

Because this is now the part of the OS itself, it is invisible to antivirus, extremely hard to identify it even existing.

# Other Malware + Rootkit == Extremely Dangerous 

Extremely potent malware called Zeus/Zbot.

Transferred money out of the victim's bank account into that of the malware author.

This was combined with the Necurs Rootkit

It made it almost impossible to remove the  malware.
Access was denied whenever any tampering was done to the malware files.


# Finding and removing rootkits

1. Some antimalware scanners can identify rootkits.
2. Rootkit removal  tools (specific to the rootkit) exist, and can be used once a rootkit is detected.
3. New BIOS software (such as secure boot with UEFI) can be used to check if the kernel has been changed, and prevents booting in such scenarios.
