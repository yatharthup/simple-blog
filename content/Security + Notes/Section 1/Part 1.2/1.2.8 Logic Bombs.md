# Types

1. Time Bomb
		Attack that triggers when a particular date and time is reached.

2. User Event Bomb 
		Turning a machine on/off is the trigger
		moving a file is the trigger
		opening a folder is the trigger

Many good logic bombs delete themselves after execution, making them difficult to identify.

#### SCADA
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition Systems, often used to manage huge electrical networks.

Ukraine's SCADA systems were compromised by a Logic bomb in 2016.

# Preventing a logic bomb

1. Difficult to detect, since there are no signatures, each one is unique.
2. Have a formal set of processes and controls for installing/modifying software on a system. If changes take place without plans in such a case, the logic bombs can be detected early on and removed.
3. Electronic/automated monitoring systems and IPS , like Tripwire
4. Constantly auditing systems via the sysadmins
