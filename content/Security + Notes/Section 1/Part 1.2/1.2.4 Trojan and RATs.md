Trojan is software that pretends to be something else, usually, a perfectly normal/legitimate piece of software. 

Trojans usually aim to conquer/control the machine and  do not care much about replication; are focused on the infected  machine.

Designed to look innocuous to both the user and the anti virus.

Once installed, it can disable the security software on the machine, and then it has free reign of the victim's machine and may create backdoors for other programs/other malware. Trojans also install PUPs.

# PUPs

Potentially Unwanted Programs

Not strictly malicious, but are unwanted and can still cause performance issues. 

Incessant ad  softwares, redirecting search engine software, unwanted browsers are all examples.

# Backdoors

Once a malware infects a machine, it wants to ensure a way to yet again infect the machine, or enter it easily. It creates backdoors for this purpose.

Some malware software can take advantage of backdoor software created by other malware for their own entry/propagation.

Some softwares (unintentionally or intentionally) include backdoors.

# RATs

Remote Administration Tool or Remote Access Trojans can be installed via these backdoors, giving  a third party complete access over the victim's OS.

--> Key logging
--> Screenshotting
--> File copying
--> Further malware embedding

Ex: DarkComet RAT

# Prevention

Similar to any other malware.

1. Don't run unknown software
2. Have a backup
3. Keep sec patches updated
