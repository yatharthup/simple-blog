# Adware
Causes performance problems in your pc.

Might get installed accidently. 

Be wary of software claiming to be specifically designed to remove Adware as it is often malware/adware itself.
Known, good antivirus/antimalware software can remove adware as well, no specialised removal software that markets itself shadily is required.
MalwareBytes is an exception
# Spyware

More malicious than adware

Malware that spies on the victim to extract sensitive information. Might keylog, screeenshare, monitor usage behaviour, usually great for recon for the attacker.

Can trick the victim into installing trojans and other malware as well


# Prevention

Similar to other malware types.
