# Malicious USB cable/ Flash Drives

A normal looking USB cable that has additional electronics in it.

Might identify itself as a HID (Human Interface  Device) to your OS, like a keyboard.

Since a keyboard doesn't require extra rights or permissions.

And then start entering commands masquerading as the user itself. Can also be controlled remotely by a threat actor.


In older OS, the files on a USB would be automatically run (removed now). 
--> Which older systems? ==> Check for this

Can act as an ethernet adapter  and then modify /redirect internet traffic requests, or act as a wireless gateway for other devices.

#### Prevention
--> Don't just plug in any unknown USB cable/flash drive


# Skimming

Stealing card info during a normal transaction.

Copying data from the magnetic stripe : Card number/ exp date/card holder's name

Extra hardware is added to the physical device  that is interacting with the cards (ex, card readers/payment machines). Hidden cameras at ATMs to see the PINs are also considered a part of skimming. 

Check carefully before using card systems.


#  Card Cloning

When the attackers need a physical card, they use info from card skimming to create physical clones.

The magnetic stripe at the back of the card is cloned, so this can only be cloned with magnetic stripe cards. (The chip cannot be cloned)

RFID chip cards are safer
