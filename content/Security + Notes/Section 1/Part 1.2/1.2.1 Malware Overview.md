#### What malware can do:

# How malware can spread

A worm might install a malware, which then downloads a botnet client. Everything works together.

# Prevention

The machine must run a program for it to get infected with malware.

1. Do not randomly click download links
2. Be vary of Web-page pop ups  
3. Webpages that download automatically  shouldn't be allowed to (can be checked via the browser's settings)
4. Maintain latest  security for both the OS and the  installed apps on your  machine (the vuln can be exploited by a minor worm which can then be used by serious malware as  an entry point)
