# Data Loss

Sometimes the data's loss itself is much, much more severe than the financial aspect of it.

Occurs especially when the Databases are not properly secured, and there are no or subpar backups.

Complete deletion or a significant part of databases are often removed.

Ex: July 2020 meowattack

# Identity Theft

Data from these vuln databases is stolen instead of deleted and then used in other operations, masquerading as the stolen identity.

# Financial Loss

Very obvious. 

Ex: March 2016: Bank of Bangladesh

--> Was a SWIFT vuln (there have been others)

# Reputation Loss

This can affect sales, and also directly effect the Stock prices of the company

Ex: Uber October 2016


# Availability and Uptime Loss

In a way, a DOS.

Ex: September 2020 BancoEstado
