# Zero Day Attacks

Many applications have vuln that are not known about , yet.

A zero day attack is an exploit using a vuln that is not known in the present, and so, no patch for it is available at that moment.

Very difficult to mitigate these, stopping something that we had no idea existed.

# Open Permissions

Info has been left on the internet, without any sec applied, and anyone can access that data.

Increasingly common with Cloud Storage.

Ex: June 2017 Verizon records exposed

# Unsecured Root Accounts

Usually due to misconfigurations.

Some preventions:
1. Use strong passwords and non-generic usernames.
2. Disable direct login to the root account.
3. Have few, protected accounts with root access (not too many)

# Errors

Error messages can some times provide too much information about the system.

ex: September 2015 Patreon Compromise

# Weak Encryption

Make sure to use strong encryption protocols, with long enough keys. (usually more than 128 bit)

Make sure hashing algorithms used are safe.

Some cipher suites are easier to break than others. 

Ex: TLS is one of the most common issue source.


# Insecure Protocols

Some protocols aren't Encrypted and all traffic is sent in the clear.

Telnet, FTP, SMTP, IMAP are examples.

In many cases, the network can be configured to use the safer, encrypted analogues of these protocols : SSH, SFTP, IMAPS 


# Default Settings of Tech systems

Every application and network device has a default login and a lot of the times people leave them as such. These are great targets for attackers , as the defaults are usually publicly available info.

Ex: Mirai Botnet

Takes advantage of IoT devices.
Uses default configs on cameras , routers, doorbells, etc

Mirai botnet software is open source.


# Open Ports and Services

Ports are opened to allow for communication from the server to the relevant devices. 
However, this also creates openings *into* the server. It is thus, important to manage access, using firewalls most commonly.

Firewall rulesets over time can easily become very complex, and mistakes can be made that allow intended access to certain resources.

Always audit and test (double/triple check)

# Improper Patch management 

Often centrally managed by a group of people.

Patches might be associated with the firmware of the device/ OS/ Apps

Improper patch management and not updating to the latest versions can cause huge loopholes in the systems sometimes.

Ex: May to July 2017 Equifax Data Breach

# Legacy Platforms/ Systems

Devices that are running very old software, with known or unknown sec vuln.

May be irreplaceable/ or not easily replaceable in a lot of situations, so, to deal with it, we may require additional firewall features added for sec
