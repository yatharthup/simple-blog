Called XSS

Originally called cross site because of browser sec flaws (info from one site could be shared  with another)

One of the most common web based app vuln

Malware uses JS

# Non persistent (reflected) XSS attack

Found on websites that allow script running within user input fields.

1. Attacker emails a link to  the victim that takes adv of this  vuln
2. Script embedded in the URL executes in the victim's browser (as if it came from the legitimate server)
3. The script  sends the user credentials/session IDs/ cookies to the attacker 

// very sneaky attack
//very specifically crafted link that  HAS to be clicked by the user for the attack to work

# Persistent (stored)  XSS attack

The attack is stored on the website's server.

Ex: The attacker posts a message to a social service  {which includes the malicious payload}
Everyone who interacts with  the message on the website is affected.

//no specific target & all viewers to the page are targeted

//anyone visiting the page runs the script

# Protecting against XSS attacks

1. Do not click untrusted links
2. Disable JS entirely (not always possible)
3. Control JS usage with an  extension
4. Keep browsers updated
5. From a dev perspective, always validate input, so that a user cannot add a script as an input
