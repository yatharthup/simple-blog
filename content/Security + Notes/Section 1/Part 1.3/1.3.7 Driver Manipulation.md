Antivirus software is very good at detecting and mitigating KNOWN strains of viruses, because of the database of digital signatures available.

Zero day attacks (no known signatures), new attack types are still safe from anti virus

Drivers are responsible for the interaction b/w the OS and the hardware. Driver attacks are creative and unexpected, and are a great opportunity for sec issues. Hardware interactions contain sensitive info.

# Example : HP Audio Driver 2016.
Conexant Audio chips
Driver installation included audio control software
Debugging feature enables a keylogger



# Shimming

A filling in the the space b/w 2 objects.

Ex: piece of folded paper to prop a chair up 

Shims are also built into OS.

Windows Compatibility Mode is an example of a shim.

This uses an App Compatibility Shim Cache.

##### Malware authors  write their own shims to take adv of this.
Ex: Jan 2015 microsoft vuln priv esc

# Refactoring


Metamorphic malware

Makes the malware appear different each time it is downloaded , effectively avoiding antivirus detection.

Examples: 
1. Might add NOP (no-operation instructions to the code)
2. Loops , pointless code strings
3. Can intelligently redesign itself

//needs layered approaches to prevent /protect against. Very hard to detect and mitigate
