Faults on developers' ends

A programming conundrum that happens when multiple things (that are NOT expected to occur at the same time) happen simultaneously, effectively breaking the service.

Race conditions can be taken adv of  by the attackers  using a TOCTOU attack.

TOCTOU --> Time of Check to Time of Use Attack

--> Check the system
--> When are the results of the last check used?
--> The time frame b/w the check and the use is used for exploitation

Another Race Condition occurred on Mars Rover Spirit 2004
Also, GE Energy 2003 US Northeast Blackout
