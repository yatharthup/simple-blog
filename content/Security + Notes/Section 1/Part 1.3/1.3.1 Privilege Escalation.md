Gaining Higher level access to the system.
--> Might  exploit a  vuln /design flaw

Higher level access often means more capabilities

Privilege escalation can also be horizontal.

User A , at a similar authority level as User B, has access to their files (which they're not supposed to)

# Mitigating Privilege Esc

1. Patch them quickly
2. Anti-virus/anti-malware  software
3. OS has in built sec measures against privilege like Data Execution Prevention.
			Data Exec Prev only allows applications to run in certain specified areas of memory
			where those functions are allowed

4. Address space layout randomisation
			If an attacker knows the memory location of a file in one instance of the OS, this prevents them from instantly getting to it at the same location in another instance.
		// Prevent a buffer overrun at a known mem adr
