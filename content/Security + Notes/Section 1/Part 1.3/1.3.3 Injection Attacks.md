Code injection attack  is when the attacker puts their own code into an existing data stream.
Bad programming is a reason this exists.

This is enabled  because of  bad programming. The user should  inmost cases not be allowed to  input  scripts in place of  normal inputs.

HTML, SQL, XML, LDAP, etc --> Data types that can be used for an injection attack

# SQL injection

Modifying SQL requests

Use webgoat to practice SQL injection

# XML injection and LDAP injection

XML --> Extensible markup language
 // is a set of rules for data transfer and storage

XML Injection
//Modifiying XML req

LDAP --> Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
//Created by  telephone companies
// Now used ubiquitously
// Normally used to store authentication info or other info  about  users and devices 

LDAP injection
//MOdifies LDAP req

# DLL injection

Dynamic Link Library (often we do  download missing DLL  files, think of  it)

> A DLL is a windows library with code and data. Often many apps would use it.

DLL injection injects a DLL and then have an app run the program (as a normal part of its process)
Runs as a part of the target process  B

# DLL injec process

Process B (attacker) --- attaches itself to A, and allocates some mem for the DLL library and then copies DLL into A--- > Process A (victim) ---> executes the DLL as a normal process while at the same time giving the DLL more rights than what B could not normally have
