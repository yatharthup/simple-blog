Aka HTTP downgrade

Combines an on-path attack with a downgrade attack.
--> Difficult to implement but has huge returns

1. Attacker has to sit in the middle  of the conversation b/w  the client and the server and must modify the data
2. Proxy servers / ARP spoofing/ rogue Wi-Fi hotspots can be used by the attacker 
3. Victim doesn't see anything unusual other than their only being HTTP instead of the usual HTTPS

// This attacked can be stopped by making sure that both the client-side and server side softwares are updated enough to prevent HTTPS downgrading to HTTP

# SSL and TLS

SSL 2.0 --> deprecated in 2011

SSL 3.0 --> susceptible to POODLE attack. Deprecated in June 2015

name change to TLS

TLS 1.0 --> allows downgrade func to help comm with SSL 3.0

TLS1.1 --> deprecated Jan 2020

###### TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 --> in use today

TLS 1.2 is considered safe only when any weak ciphers/ encryp algo are removed

# Prevention

Web servers do NOT respond to http requests
