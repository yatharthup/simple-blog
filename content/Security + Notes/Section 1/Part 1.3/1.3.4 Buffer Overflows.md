Another result of poor programming and app devs should perform detailed bounds checking.

Is not a simple exploit. Since a bad buffer overflow attack can instead crash the entire system.

A useful buffer overflow is repeatable (and targeted upon the specific memory locations) which
means the system can be repeatedly compromised.

Buffer overflow can be used for privilege esc or DDoS
