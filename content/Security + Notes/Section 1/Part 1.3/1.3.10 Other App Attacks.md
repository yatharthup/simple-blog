# Memory Vulnerabilities

Manipulating mem is very advantageous, but usually relatively difficult to acomplish.

#### Memory Leak

1. Unused mem is NOT properly released
2. The application's memory quota keeps growing in size
3. The app eventually uses ALL available memory 
4. the system crashes

# NULL pointer Dereference

The attacker might make a pointer point to nothing in the memory, and this might cause the app to crash

# Integer Overflow

Large Number is sent to a smaller sized space in the mem

The remaining portion overflows into other sections of memory

Should be mitigated by the dev

Very hard to craft an exploit like this that can be repeated over and over (due to newer programming languages having automatic mem management so that even the newest of programmers don't fall victim to ineffective mem management)


# Directory Traversal / Path traversal attack

Exploit vuln that might allow users to browse outside of the service-paths offered on the web server.

Usually these attacks take adv of badly written code

cd .. OR FOR WINDOWS ../ might help the attacker to move outside the webserv path

# Improper error handling

Error Messages should be tailored to NOT show sens info

ex:
1. network info
2. mem dump
3. stack traces
4. database dumps

// this is over-information 


Easy issue to fix by following development best practices

# Improper Input Handling

Talked about in detailed over the course of the prior attacks

# API attack

Attacker tries to manipulate the application programming interface.

Look for vuln in the new comm path

# Resource Exhaustion

A specialised DoS attack.

Devices with Low bandwidths are susceptible

#### ZIP bombs attacks (42 kb)

A 42 kb .zip compressed file
Uncompresses to 4.5 petabytes (4500 TB)

//Very well known and most antiviruses identify these

#### DHCP starvation

Network based resource exhaustion

Attacker floods a network with IP addr req
MAC addr changes each time (so that it seems like there are new devices  being connected)
DHCP serv runs out of IP addr

Anyone else who tries to connect will not be given an ip, and will not be able to connect to the network

Prevention : Switch configurations that can limit the rate of ip addr requests. Can help with mitigation to a certain point and/or slow down the attack considerably
