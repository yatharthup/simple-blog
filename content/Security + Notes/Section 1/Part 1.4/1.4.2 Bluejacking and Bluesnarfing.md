# Bluejacking

Sending of unsolicited messages to another device via Bluetooth

Due to the physical proximity requirements of Bluetooth the attacker is in a small radius near the victim (10m or so)

Low priority sec concern (since it only sends a message and nothing else)

# Bluesnarfing

High priority

An attacker can access data on the device using Bluetooth.

Might be seen in very old devices (2003 era) (modern devices are patched)
