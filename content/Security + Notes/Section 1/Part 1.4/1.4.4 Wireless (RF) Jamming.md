DoS; prevents wireless communication

The goal is to decrease the signal to noise ratio at the receiving device
If the signal to noise ratio is sufficiently decreased, the  receiving device will NOT be able to comm on the wireless network. 

Interference(ex: from microwave ovens) is not malicious
Jamming is malicious when someone does NOT want the network to work

# Types/ Methods/ Techniques

1. Constant noise 
	can be random noise
	might also be a constant amount of traffic sending legitimate signals, but using up ALL of the bandwidth
2. Intermittently sending random noise/legit frames 
3. Only sending jamming signals when some specific tries to comm to the network

// The jamming device needs to be physically close to the WAP for it to overpower the WAP's signals

A Fox hunt is the process to track down the jamming devices.

--> A directional antennae and headphones to look for a strong signal
