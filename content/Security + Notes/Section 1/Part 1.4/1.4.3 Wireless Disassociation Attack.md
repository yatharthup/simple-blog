A DoS attack that causes devices on a network to  suddenly NOT  being able to connect/communicate at all to a Wireless Access Point


//802.11 wireless includes a number of management frames
# How devices connect to and disconnect from a wireless network

1. Mobile device has to send a number of management frames to the access point
2. Access points reply back to the mobile device (again using management frames)
3. These management frames are not visible to the normal user

These management frames are important for the operation of 802.11 wireless and have the following functions:
help to find Access points
manage QoS (quality of service)
Associate/dissociate with an access point etc

###### The original standards did not add any protection for management frames
They were sent in the clear 
They did not authenticate or validate where the management packets came from

# running a WD attack

1. Packet capture
2. Wireless Management frames section has the details
3. We direct an attack towards a particular device by using the Wi-Fi address of the device

$$airodump-ng$$

// shows the bssid (access point) and all connected devices

					aireplay-ng -0 100 -a bssid -c mob_dev_addr wlan0mon
//sends the deauth frames

# Protection against deauth attacks

IEEE addressed the problem in 2014

Now, some of the more important management frames are encrypted.

1. Dissociate, deauthenticate, channel switch announcements


However not ALL management frames can be encrypted, some HAVE to be unencrypted so that devices can Connect to the WAP.

Some of these are:
1. Beacons
2. Probes
3. Authentication
4. Association


This 802.11w protection is req for 802.11ac compliance
