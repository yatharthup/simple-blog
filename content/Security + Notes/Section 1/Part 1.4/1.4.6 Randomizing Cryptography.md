One of the core needs of crypt is that the resulting data should look nothing like the plaintext.

Cryptography without randomisation can give out info to the attacker.

128 bit ECB (electronic code book) is a non-randomised encryption method

# Cryptographic Nonce

Nonce --> number used only once (pseudo random, or random number)

Comes from the term "from the nonce" --> for the time being

// A nonce can also be a counter as long as long as both sides are able to keep track of what the counter's value might be

#### Often used during a login process 

1. server gives the client a nonce
2. password hash is calculated using the nonce
3. Each password hash sent to the host will be different, which prevents replay attacks if the attacker has a password hash, since it will be different for every connection session

//nonce and salts are quite similar. However, nonces are strictly one-time random numbers and should not be reused, and are locally random, whereas salts being used multiple times or even statically aren't a problem. Also, salts are used for hashing specifically

Server sends a new nonce every time.

Also used in SSL/TLS connection encryptions


# Initialisation Vector

A type of nonce we commonly use in encryption.

Init vec + WEP key == stronger


# Salt

A nonce commonly associated with oass randomisation.

Each user gets a different salt. This makes even similar passwords be stored differently as hashes
