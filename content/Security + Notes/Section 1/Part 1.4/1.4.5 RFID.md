Radio Frequency Identification

They're everywhere:
1. Access badges
2. Inventory/Assembly Line Tracking
3. Pet / Animal tracking/Identification
4. Anything that needs to be tracked

Flat RFIDs have no batteries. Instead, the signal that we send to the RFID tag POWERS the tag itself and then the tag is able to transmit its ID back to us.
Similar to this, most RFIDs have unidirectional comm, however, some implementations have bidirectional comm as well , which have to be powered/active


{how exactly does this work? This is VERY cool}

# Vuln

Since this is a wireless comm as well, many of the comm vuln of wireless comm can be seen here as well
####  Data Capture
1. Capturing data b/w the tag and the RFID reader, especially if not encrypted
2. Replay attacks
#### Spoofing the reader
And sending info to the tag that modifies the information of the RFID tag

#### DoS
By jamming the frequencies related to the tag

#### Decrypt communication b/w the tag and reader
As many of the encryption keys have gotten out and are on the internet (even google)

# NFC

Near Field Communication

Two way wireless comm technology that builds on RFID.

1. Seen in store payment options (mobile phone/smartwatches for payment)
2. Bluetooth using NFC to simplify the pairing process (so that the devices can connect when in vicinity without PINs)
3. Access Tokens/ ID cards 
	Short range with encryption support


## NFC sec concerns

similar as RFID

1. Remote capture (10m radius)
2. Frequency jamming (DoS)
3. Relay/ Replay attacks
4. Loss of the devices with the RFC control
