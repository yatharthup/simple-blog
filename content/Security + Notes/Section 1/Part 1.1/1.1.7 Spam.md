## Identifying spam

1. Have a trusted /allowed senders list
		Needs high maintenance to keep up-to-date and set up, but is very effective

2. Check for SMTP standards / RFC standards

3. Perform a R-DNS (reverse DNS)
	Block email where the domain name does NOT match with the associated IP addr

4. Tarpitting
	Intentionally slow down our mail server so the to and fro of packets takes time .
	This in-turn also slows down the spam attacker's server and they get frustrated and choose to skip over.

5. Recipient Filtering
	Block all email addressed to non-valid users (for organisations)

// Many different strategies must be used in tandem to effectively stop spam, no One single way is enough.
