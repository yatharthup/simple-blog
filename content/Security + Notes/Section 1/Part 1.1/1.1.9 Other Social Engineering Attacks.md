# Tailgating

> Use an authorised person to gain unauthorised access to a protected area.

Ex: Sneaking into a "staff-only" room behind a legitimate staff member that opens the door using their key

--> Use similar clothing  to make yourself feel a part of the org and prompting an actual employee help you enter

--> Pretending to be a delivery person

### Preventing

1. Visitor Policies
2. Security cameras
3. Access Control Vestibule /Airlock
	Only allows one person in at a time
4. Simply asking who and why a certain person is there


# Invoice Scam

Starts with a bit of spear phishing. (Might need some serious  recon knowledge on part of  the hacker)

It works on the basis of most people simply choosing to pay bills sent over to them.

Bills that look very similar to/ emulates an actual service  being used.

The bill is directly sent over to the group/person that pays the bills


# Credential Harvesting

Login creds/ passwords are harvested from apps like browsers/notes

Scripts are run on the local systems of the organisation to identify and pull the req info.

The way this attack works often makes no signals to the people that are affected by it.
