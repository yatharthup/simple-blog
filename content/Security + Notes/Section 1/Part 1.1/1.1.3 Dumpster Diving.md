The attacker literally dives into physical trash discarded by people and can extract information via it. 

Receipts, Phone numbers, bills, other items can reveal a lot about what was done by the victim in the past few days/weeks.

This information can then be used as extremely tailored recon for other attacks.

> Things in the garbage are mostly public, there is no law against dumpster diving, so the attacker is usually safe.


# Protecting against dumpster Diving

1. Physically secure your dumping location
2. Shred documents, do not dispose things just as they were usually. Burn extremely sensitive info 
3. Be mindful of how you dispose of things in general, to disfigure them to an unidentifiable form from the original, if they might reveal sensitive info about you
