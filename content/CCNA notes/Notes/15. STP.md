Network redundancy is an essential part of network design.

Network redundancy isÂ **the process of providing multiple paths for traffic so that data can keep flowing even in the event of a failure**,

try to have redundancy in as many connections as possible.

> Most PCs only have a single Network Interface Cards (NICs) so they can only be plugged to one switch at a time. 
> Important servers, however, have multiple NICs to get plugged into multiple Switches to maintain Network Redundancy.


# Classic STP 

Spanning Tree Protocol is a LAYER 2 PROTOCOL, that enables redundant layer 2 networks.

Without STP , redundant networks fall into broadcast storms.
(also, MAC addr flapping)

ARP requests keep looping infinitely. 

Classic STP is IEEE 802.1D

Switches from ALL VENDORS run STP by default.

STP classifies interfaces as:
1. blocking state
2. forwarding state --> Act normally 

STP prevents Layer 2 looping by placing redundant loops in a blocking state, essentially disabling the interfaces until needed.
Interfaces in a blocking state only receive(or send) STP messages (called BPDUs, Bridge Protocol Data Units)

// same topology but with classic STP


## How it works

### 1. Selecting the root bridge

STP enabled switches send/receive "Hello BPDUs" out of all interfaces, once every 2 seconds.

If a switch receives a Hello BPDU on an interface, it'll know it's connected to another switch on that interface, since only switches use STP.


Switches use Bridge ID field in the STP BPDU to elect a root bridge for the network.

> The switch with the lowest bridge ID becomes the root bridge.

ALL INTERFACES ON THE ROOT BRIDGE ARE FORWARDING, and all other switches must have a path to reach the root bridge.

![[Pasted image 20240815222310.png]]
// traditionally this is the Bridge ID field on the STP BPDU.

![[Pasted image 20240815222347.png]]
// This is the old Bridge ID


![[Pasted image 20240815222532.png]]
// Sw1 has the lowest MAC addr (since the IDs on all of them are the same), and so, it becomes the root bridge.


Newer Bridge ID looks like :

![[Pasted image 20240815222701.png]]![[Pasted image 20240815222740.png]]
In the default VLAN1 , the default priority is 32768 + 1 = 32769

We can change the bridge priority on the switches for a particular VLAN. Sw1 could be the root bridge for VLAN 10, SW2 could be the root bride in VLAN 30 and so on.

All interfaces on the root bridge are designated ports.
Designated ports are in a forwarding state.


When a switch is powered on , it assumes itself as the root bridge. 
It'll only give up its position if it receives a superior BPDU (one with a lower Bridge ID)

Once the topology has converged and all switches agree on the root bridge, then only the root bridge will send BPDUs, the others will only forward them, and not generate their own.

### 2. Selecting the root port

On every switch other than the root bridge, ONE of its interfaces is a *root port*. Root ports are also in a forwarding state.


The interface with the lowest root cost is the root port.

![[Pasted image 20240815224011.png]]

The ports of the Root bridge have a root cost of 0.


![[Pasted image 20240815224206.png]]![[Pasted image 20240815224310.png]]

// ports across from the root ports are always designated ports.

If the root cost of multiple switch interfaces is the same, the interface connected to the neighbour with the LOWEST BRIDGE ID becomes the root port.

If even this is same (as in, the switches have 2 port connections between them), then the port with the lowest neighbour port ID is used.

> STP port ID = port priority (default 128) + port number

### 3. Blocking ports

> Remember, EVERY COLLISION DOMAIN HAS A SINGLE STP DESGINATED PORT.

## A summary of the classic STP process until now

![[Pasted image 20240815225423.png]]

# Spanning tree port states

There are 4: 

1. blocking --> stable
2. forwarding --> Stable
3. Learning --> Transitional
4. Listening --> transitional


## Blocking

Non designated

Essentially disabled

Receive only BPDUs. (doesn't forward)

Do not learn MAC addr/ receive regular traffic.


## Listening (transitional)

Only Designated / root ports enter the listening state.

15 sec long (determined by forward delay timer)

Only forwards and receives STP BPDUs / no regular traffic


## Learning (transitional)

Again 15 sec.

Only receives and sends STP BPDUs.

Does NOT receive or send normal traffic, but DOES learn and populate its MAC addr table from the incoming traffic.

## Forwarding 

Normal port behaviour

![[Pasted image 20240816002926.png]]

# Spanning Tree Timers
![[Pasted image 20240816002955.png]]

Switches only forward their BPDUs on their designated ports.

Hello and Forward Delay have been explained. 

> Max age:
> 1. If another BPDU is received before Max Age timer goes from 20 to 0, the max age timer resets to 20.
> 2. If that doesn't happen and the timer goes to 0, the switch will revaluate its STP choices: root bridge, root port and designated port choices and then will transition the blocked port to the forwarding state, through listening and learning states. (50 seconds total. 20 + 15 + 15)


> However, a forwarding state interface directly moves to the blocking state, since there is no chance of looping there.


![[Pasted image 20240816003804.png]]
Regular STP uses a dest mac addr of 0180.c200.0000

> root path cost : 0 means that it's the root bridge that sent this BPDU directly.

# STP Toolkit

## 1. Portfast

Can be enabled on interfaces that are enables on end hosts, ports go immediately from a forwarding to a blocking state.

![[Pasted image 20240816004546.png]]
// Enabled at an interface level.

![[Pasted image 20240816004629.png]]

## 2. BPDU guard

If an interface with BPDU guard configured receives a BPDU , it will block itself and shut down.

![[Pasted image 20240816004853.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240816004906.png]]

Portfast + BPDU guard is the way to go.

![[Pasted image 20240816005024.png]]
// how it looks like when a port with bpdu guard receives a bpdu frame


To turn on a port shut by BPDU guard again:

Use the shutdown command, and then the no shutdown command to restart.

## 3. root guard and loop guard

![[Pasted image 20240816005258.png]]


# Basic STP configs

mst --> Multiple STP (not for CCNA)
pvst --> PerVLAN spanning tree (what we've learnt till now, CISCO proprietory)
rapid-pvst --> more on this later

![[Pasted image 20240816005510.png]]

### Manually configuring the root bridge

And secondary root bridge (next in line switch that takes over as root bridge when the current one fails)

![[Pasted image 20240816005728.png]]
// This switch has now become the root bridge.

![[Pasted image 20240816005833.png]]

// Bridge priorities are sent in multiples of 4096.

# STP Load Balancing

Using different STP configs for different VLANs, to allow for the most passing of traffic. We let STP configure one of it by itself, and then we configure the other VLAN topologies manually, so that the unused ports in one STP are used in others.

## STP Port Setting Configs

// we can change this to change the result of the root port selection process.
