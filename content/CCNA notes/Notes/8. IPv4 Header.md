The layer 3 header --> So we'll be talking in terms of Packets instead of frames.

![[Pasted image 20240803171804.png]]
### 1.Version Field

Length --> 4 bits
Identifies the version of IP in Use (in binary).

IPv4 --> 0100
IPv6 --> 0110

IPv5 was an experimental protocol called the Internet Stream and was never used commercially.

The other fields change if the version is IPv6, but since we're focusing on IPv4 here, we'll look at the associated structure.

### 2. IHL (internet Header Length) Field

Length --> 4 bits

Since the final field of the IPv4 header (the Options field) is variable in length, IHL field is necessary to indicate the total length of the header.

Identifies the Length of the header in 4 BYTE (32 bits) increments.

Minimum Value of IHL is 5 (20 BYTES) --> This means an empty options field.

Maximum Value is 15 (60 BYTES) --> 40 BYTE options field 

### 3. DSCP Field (Differentiated Services Code Point)

Length --> 6 bits

Field is used for QoS (Quality of service). More on this later.

Essentially, this field is used to prioritize delay-sensitive data (streaming voice/video, etc)

### 4. ECN Field (Explicit Congestion Notification)

Length --> 2 bits

Provides End-to-end Notification of Network Congestion WITHOUT dropping packets.

Normally , in networks, a drop in packets signals congestion; however, ECN gives a way to do that without the loss of packets.

However this is an optional field that requires both end points and required network infrastructure to support it.


### 5. Total Length Field

Length --> 16 bits

Indicates the total length of the packet (L3 header + L4 Segment)

Measured in bytes (Unlike 4 byte increments like IHL)

Min Value == 20 --> IPv4 Header with encapsulated data
Max Value == 65,535 --> All 16 bits set to 1.


### 6. Identification Field 

Length --> 16 bits

If a packet is fragment due to being too large, this field is used to identify which packet the fragment belongs to.(so that it can be reassembled again by the end machine to make the original packet.)

All fragments of the same packet will have their own IPv4 headers (obvious) however the value in this field (the IDENTIFICATION FIELD) will be the same for all of them.

*When are Packets Fragmented?*
Packets are fragmented when they are larger than the MTU (maximum transmission unit).
The MTU is usually 1500 bytes (related to the Maximum Payload size of an Ethernet Frame)

These fragments are then reassembled by the receiving host.

### 7. Flags Field

Length --> 3 bits

Used to control and identify fragments.

Bit 0 --> Reserved and Always set to 0.

Bit 1 --> DF (don't fragment) bit. Used to indicate a packet to NOT be fragmented

Bit 2 --> MF (more fragments) bit. Set to 1 if there are more fragments in the packet, set to 0 for the last fragment. Unfragmented bits will have their MF bit set to 0.


### 8. Fragment Offset Field

Length --> 13 bits

Used to indicate the position of the fragment within the original , unfragmented IP packet.

Allows fragmented packets to be reassembled even is the fragmented packets arrive out of order.

### 9. Time to Live Field

Length -> 8 bits

If the TTL (time to live) field of a packet is 0 , the ROUTER WILL DROP IT.

This is used to prevent infinite loops --> Caused by poor routing configurations. 
// A packet is sent around in a loop in a network, never reaching its intended destination. Enough of such packets and the network crashes.

This feature was originally designed to indicate the packet's maximum lifetime in seconds. 

In practice now, however, this indicates a 'hop count': each time the packet arrives at a router , the router decreases the TTL by 1.

Current Recommended TTL Length --> 64.

### 10. Protocol Field 

Length --> 8 bits

Indicates the protocol of the encapsulated Layer 4 PDU

Typically one of the following: 

TCP --> 6
UDP --> 17
ICMP --> 1 (the protocol ping uses)
OSPF(Open Shortest Path First, a dynamic routing protocol which allows routers to learn routes to destinations from their neighbours, instead of us having to manually configure them) --> 89

### 11. Header Checksum Field

Length --> 16 bits

A calculated checksum used to check for errors in the IPv4 header.

When a router receives a packet, it calculates its own checksum from the received info and then compares it to this field. If the values do not match, the packet is dropped.

ONLY CHECKS FOR ERROR IN THE IPv4 HEADER, most protocols for the encapsulated data have their own checksums.

### 12. Source IP address field

Length --> 32 bits (length of an IPv4 packet)

IPv4 address of the sender of the packet.

Already covered in detail.
### 13. Destination IP address field

Length --> 32 bits (length of an IPv4 packet )

IPv4 address of the intended receiver of the packet.

Already covered in detail.

### 14. Options Field

Length --> 0 to 320 bits (0 to 40 bytes)

This field is rarely used.

## Expanding the IPv4 Header Section

![[Pasted image 20240803182035.png]]
// As we can see, Wireshark categorises both DSCP and ECN under the differentiated Services field.

// Total Length is 100 bytes since that is the default ping size in CISCO routers. (However, it can also be set to more or less as desired.)

//Wireshark also includes Fragment Offset field under the Flags field.

// As mentioned before, most headers do NOT have an options field. This ping request header is missing one too.

## Sending a Large ping (10000 bytes) and examining it in Wireshark

![[Pasted image 20240803182822.png]]

Now let's take a look at the IPv4 header fields in the first 2 fragments.

![[Pasted image 20240803183030.png]]
// Both have the same Identification Field value.

// Both have DF bit set to 0 (not set)

// Both have MF field set to 1 (since neither is the final fragment)

// Both have different fragment offset values.

// Both are 1500 bytes (max allowed size MTU) in length.

> If packets larger than the MTU are sent with the DF bit set to 1, no packets are sent.
