# Routing

The process that routers use to determine the path am IP packet must take to reach its destination.

And routers store all known routes in their routing table (similar to MAC addr tables in switches)

# How routers Learn routes

There are 2 methods : 
1. Dynamic Routing 
	using protocols like OSPF(Open Shortest Path first) to share information and automatically populate their routing tables.

2. Static Routing 
	A network engineer manually configures the routes on a router.


Here we will cover a kind of Route that fits in neither category.

# Route

A Route tells a router

> To send a packet to destination X, you must send the packet to *next hop* Y or the destination directly (if connected directly) or if the destination IP is the same as the router, to keep the packet for itself (don't forward it.)



// Next hop --> Next router on the path of the destination 


# The Network we'll use (A WAN example)

The IP addresses we'll be using for each part are

Here, we'll focus on 2 types of routes automatically added to a router's routing table. (neither dynamic nor static routing)

Let us configure r1 first as an example:

![[Pasted image 20240804073642.png]]


Use the 

		R1# show ip route

to show the routing table for r1.

// The CODES legend highlights the different protocols that the routers can use to learn routes.

L - Local --> A route to the actual IP addr configured on the interface, with a /32 netmask.

C - Connected --> A route to the network the interface is connected to (with the actual netmask configured on the interface)


// As we can see , even though we've not configured any routes yet, in the Gateway legend, 6 routes are already set.
	This happens because when we configure an IP addr on an interface and enable it with *no shutdown* , 2 routes (per interface) will automatically be added to the routing table; a connected and local route. (these are neither dynamic nor manual, these are automatically configured. )

**If the dest IP addr of the packet matches no route on the routing table, then the packet is dropped by the router (no match case). If it matches, it is sent down the relevant interface (match case).**

> A route MATCHES a packet's dest if the packet's dest is part of the network specified in the route.

## Connected and Local Routes

A *CONNECTED ROUTE* is a route TO THE NETWORK THE INTERFACE IS CONNECTED TO.

It provides a route to all hosts in that network.


![[Pasted image 20240804074548.png]]
// From here, the router knows that the Router is connected DIRECTLY to 192.168.1.0/24 and it provides a route to all hosts connected to that network. (i.e hosts with IPs 192.168.1.1-255). Whenever such a host is encountered , the router knows that it must send the packet through the interface G0/2.


A *LOCAL ROUTE* is a route to the exact IP addr configured on the interface.

/32 netmask means ALL THE BITS ARE FIXED. 
This is used to identify the EXACT IP ADDR OF THE INTERFACE.

So even though here

![[Pasted image 20240804075256.png]]

R1's g0/2 is configured as 192.168.1.1/24, the connected route is 192.168.1.1/32. This means that r1 knows, that if there is a packet for this IP addr (192,168.1.1), that packet is for me.

### Route Selection

A packet (for ex, 192.168.1.1 in this case), matches for both the connected and local route, where does the router send this packet then?

*It chooses the more specific route in such a case.* 

Therefore, the router selects the Local Route.

The Local Routes are extremely specific with /32 netmasks due to this reason.

> What does the line 
> "192.168.1.0/24 is variably subnetted, 2 subnets, 2 masks"
> mean?

It means in the routing table, there are 2 routes to subnets that fit within the 192.168.1.0/24 class C network, with 2 diff netmasks /24 and /32. 
More on subnetting later.
The point was, that lines like this are NOT routes.

> Unlike *switches* that flood packets when they do not have a dest, routers DO NOT FLOOD, THEY DROP THE NON MATCHING PACKETS.


*More specific routing match is the one with the longer prefix (/number) length*

**Switches look for exact matches in the MAC table, and there is NO concept of more specific matches in switches.**
