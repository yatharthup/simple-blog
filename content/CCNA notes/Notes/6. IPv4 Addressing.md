Part of network layer (layer 3) --> Logical addressing

![[Pasted image 20240716132628.png]]

In this , 24 represents that the first 3 groups are the network's address. --> Means that the first 24 bits of the IP addr represent the Network addr (the first 3 octets/ the first 3 bytes)

the first 3 sets of numbers (in the dark blue box) --> Represent the Network's address itself
The last set represents the device's addr on the network.
More on this in a bit.


# Routing

![[Pasted image 20240716133020.png]]


In this scenario, the broadcast STOPS at the router, it doesn't get flooded to the other networks that the router is connected to. Broadcasts are for systems ON a network, not outside it.

# IPv4 header fields

![[Pasted image 20240716133313.png]]


There are a lot of fields in the Internet Protocol's header. For now, we'll focus on the Source and Destination IP addr fields.

# IP addr

Both 32 bits (4 bytes in length). (since IP addr are 32 bits in length)

![[Pasted image 20240716133536.png]]

This method of representation of IPv4 addr : 192.18.1.32 is called the dotted decimal representation, used because this is a lot more human readable.

//Each 8 bit groups are also known as octets.

Obviously, 1 octet can represent numbers from 0 to 255.

for ex: 154.78.111.32 /16 --> means that the first 2 octets (154.78) are the network's addr.

12.128.251.23/8 --> Means 12 is the network portion, and the other 3 octets are the host portion.

/8, /16, /24 are known as netmasks.
# IP addr classes

In class A as well, the end of the range is considered to be 126, since 127 is reserved for loopback addresses. Also, 0 is reserved.
![[Pasted image 20240716135718.png]]
We will be focusing on Class A, B and C addr usually.

Class D Addr are reserved for multicast addresses. More on them later

Class E are reserved for Experimental uses, out of the scope of the course.

# Loopback Addresses

Range : 

		127.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255

These addr are used to test the Network Stack (OSI, TCP/IP model) on the local device. 

If a device sends traffic on this range, it is treated as traffic received from another device, and is simply processed back up the stack. 

![[Pasted image 20240716140407.png]]

// The PC responds back to its own ping when an IP in the loopback addr range is pinged.
// The orange box confirms how there is NO round trip time at all, since the device sending and receiving the ping are one and the same, so they can be sent and received instantaneously. The traffic isn't going anywhere.

![[Pasted image 20240716140631.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240716140650.png]]

The orange part is the network part, the blue part is the host part.

// Class A --> Lesser Networks, more hosts on each network though
// Class C --> Lesser hosts on each network, but a large number of possible networks.

![[Pasted image 20240716140926.png]]

First addr in each network is the network addr --> Hence it cannot be assigned to hosts.

Last addr in each network is the broadcast addr --> Hence this too, cannot be assigned to hosts

Therefore, the actual host count is 2 less than the numbers shown in the table above. 

So, for class C --> 254 hosts per network
Class B --> 65534
Class A --> 16777214

# Netmasks

The Slash notation is a newer, better, easier method of specifying the network bits. Commonly seen on Juniper network devices.

Cisco devices , however, still use an older way of writing the prefix length, using a dotted decimal netmask.

![[Pasted image 20240716141724.png]]

So, the prefix length slash representations and the Netmasks are different ways of saying the same thing on different devices.

# Network and Broadcast Addresses

> If the HOST portion of an address is all 0s(the bits, which is equal to zero itself, yes), it means that is the Network Address.

This is the FIRST addr of the network, but not the first usable addr.

> if the HOST portion of the address is all 1s (the bits, which is 255 for each octet, depending on the Class), then it is the Broadcast addr

This is the LAST addr of the network, but not the last usable addr.

![[Pasted image 20240716142318.png]]

So, coming back to this diagram, The MAC addr for a broadcast IP addr in the network is FFFF.FFFF.FFFF

# More on IPv4 Addressing

![[Pasted image 20240716140926.png]]

Revisiting this chart.

// Network Number bits --> self explanatory, aka prefix length
// Rest bits --> aka, host portion of the address

# Maximum hosts per network

> $$Max\space usable \space hosts \space per \space network \space = ({2^{number\space of\space host \space bits}})\space - 2 $$


Network addr == Network ID

# Commands for IP addressing

Command to confirm the status of each interface on the cisco IOS device:

		Router> enable
		Router#show ip interface brief

![[Pasted image 20240716165927.png]]

**This is the DEFAULT status of CISCO ROUTERS. Switches are NOT administratively down by default.**

// The Ok? column, is a legacy feature that is not relevant anymore. 

What it does is that it tells you if the IP addr is valid. On modern devices, you're not allowed to assign invalid IPs in the first place, so it's very rare to see a "no".

//Method 

Indicates the method by which the interface was assigned an IP addr.

// Status

The layer 1 status of the interface

Administratively down means that the interface has been disabled with the "shutdown" command.

// Protocol

The layer 2 status of the interface. Since Status is "down" the protocol columns obviously do not work.

It is possible to see protocol down when status is up, however, it is possible for protocol to be up when status is down. (obvious)

> When the router is functioning healthily and is properly configured, both fields will be up.



# Configuring the Router

## Entering Interface config mode

To configure an interface, we have to be in the interface configuration mode (accessed through global configuration mode). The relevant commands are shown in the screenshots.

		Router(config)#interface <interface name>
		Router(config-if)#

![[Pasted image 20240716170746.png]]

## Setting the IP addr

		Router(config-if)#ip address <ip address> <netmask/subnet mask in dotted decimal>

## Command to enable the interface

		Router(config-if)#no shutdown

![[Pasted image 20240716171403.png]]

// The messages after the * are updates by the system.

## Checking the status after config

![[Pasted image 20240716171822.png]]

// the "do" part allows us to access priv EXEC mode commands from other modes.

// sh ip int br --> shortcut for "show ip interface brief" command



# Configuring another interface from the following network diagram

![[Pasted image 20240716172226.png]]

We just configured for G0/0 in the previous examples, now we do the same for G0/1

![[Pasted image 20240716172303.png]]
// no shut --> shortcut for "no shutdown"

Now we configure G0/2

![[Pasted image 20240716172411.png]]


# Some more "show" commands

## 1. show interfaces command

Displays a lot of info about the interface. Primarily Layer 1 and Layer 2 info about the interface, but also shows some Layer 3 info.

The command can also be used without specifying a specific interface, but it is recommended to specify one, because otherwise it will display all the info for all the interfaces, which is a pain to deal with.


		show interfaces <interface name>

![[Pasted image 20240716172613.png]]

// The bia is the Burned in MAC addr of the interface. However, we can configure a different MAC addr for devices in the CLI as well, although usually for networking purposes we do not.


## 2. show interfaces description

from priv EXEC mode

![[Pasted image 20240716173113.png]]

Helpful information that can describe the function of the interface. there are really no rules for how to describe your interfaces.

### Configuring the Description for an interface

Enter interface config mode. 
Specify the interface

use "description" command

		Router(config-if)#description <whatever you want to describe>
