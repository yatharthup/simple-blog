Superior to Classic STP(802.1D) and Most Devices have this now.

STP Versions:

1. Classic (802.1D)
2. PVST+ (CISCO's)
3. Rapid Spanning Tree (802.1w)
4. Rapid PVST+ (CISCO's)
5. Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (802.1s)

// MSTP is best for large networks.
// For medium networks, Rapid PVST+ (for the exam as well)


# RSTP


### RSTP Cost values were updated

### R PVST+ decreases the state switching time by combining states

Blocking , listening and Disabled are combined. (Blocking and disabled were combined, and the listening state is simply not used.)

The three states of Rapid STP are:
1. Discarding (Stable)
2. Learning (Transitional)
3. Forwarding (Stable)

![[Pasted image 20240816081311.png]]
// An administratively disabled or automatically disabled are both discarding now.

Root port and root bridge concepts are unchanged.
Designated ports remain the same as well.

### Non designated port role changes

Non designated ports were divided into:

1. alternate port
2. backup Port

#### alternate port

Receives superior BPDU from another Switch.

Similar to blocking ports from classic STP. 

Functions as a backup to the root port.

If the root port fails, this port can immediately be moved to forwarding state.
(this was a classic STP additional feature: UpLinkFast. It is now in-built here)

(BackboneFast was also built into RSTP)

> BackboneFast:
> If SW2 assumes that it is the root bridge due to a connection problem between itself and SW1(root bridge), and sends BPDUs to SW3. Instead of straight up ignoring the inferior BPDU, SW3 will expire Max Age timers on its interface and rapidly forward the superior BPDUs to SW2.

#### backup port role

a discarding port that receives a superior BPDU from another interface on the SAME SWITCH.

This only happens when are 2 interfaces are connected to the same collision domain (via a hub).

Function as a backup for designated port.

# configuration

Network used:

![[Pasted image 20240816083554.png]]

		SW3(config)# spanning-tree mode rapid-pvst
// set mode to rapid pvst

		SW3(config)# do show spanning-tree
// shows the config

# RSTP BPDU

![[Pasted image 20240816083806.png]]
// Both compared side by side.

0 --> Classic STP Protocol version Identifier
2 --> R STP

// Also, look at the difference in bits in BPDU flags.

> One significant difference is that , ALL switches in Rapid STP originate and send their BPDUs from their *designated ports* (unlike Classic STP, where only the root bridge did so.)

# RSTP Link types

RSTP has 3 different link types:
1. Edge:
	A port that is connected to an end host, move straight to forwarding (PortFast functionality inbuilt). Configured similarly to classic STP (by using *spanning-tree portfast* command)
2. Point to point 
	Connection b/w 2 switches. Function in full-duplex. Usually autoconfigured, but to manually configure use *spanning-tree link-type point-to-point* command.
3. Shared
	Connection to a hub. Must operate in half-duplex mode to avoid collisions (only send or receive). Again should configure on their own, but manually done by the *spanning-tree link-type shared* command.
