Switches have much more interfaces than routers because are used to connect end hosts to, which can be a huge number depending upon the network.

// Switches are in the up state by default, with no configuration required. They also are layer 2 switch ports so the IP addresses remain unassigned since they don't really need them.
The concept of "Multi-layer switching" is where we DO assign IP addr to the switches exists. More on that in the future.

// These other interfaces are down down because they are NOT connected to any devices. 
Keep in mind that "down down" is different from administratively down. Down wodn doesn't mean that the interfaces are shutdown, it just means that they are NOT connected to any other device.

#### show ip int brief on a router

// And routers have the shutdown command applied by default. With the default state now being "administratively down / down".


## show interfaces status

![[Pasted image 20240721001858.png]]

//port field lists all the interfaces

// Name field is the description of the interfaces (a better name would've been description, but it is what it is)

// Show the status of the port. "connected, notconnected" are 2 of them. More on these later

// Again, more on Vlan later. The default is 1.

// Duplex field : indicates if a device is capable of sending and receiving data at the same time (full duplex) or if its not(which is half duplex). Duplex is auto by default on CISCO devices, ie, it will negotiate with the neighbouring device to use full duplex whenever possible.

a-full --> all of these interfaces are connected and it means it negotiated "auto" a full duplex "full".

// Speed field --> Also "auto" by default. since these are f0 ports, they are fast ethernet ports, capable of operating on 100 Mbps. However, they are also capable of operating on 10Mbps.  Auto means they negotiate with the neighbouring device to work on the fastest possible speeds the device is capable of. "a-100" means they automatically negotiated working on 100 Mbps.

//Type field : 10/100 the speeds on which the interfaces can operate.

# Manually configuring speed and duplex

Autonegotiation usually works well, but we must know how to manually configure as well.

![[Pasted image 20240721003824.png]]

1. Enter config-if mode.
2. enter Interface name
3. Enter speed command to set the speed
4. Enter Duplex command to set the Duplex
5. Enter Description command to configure the description (name)

// How it looks after this config

![[Pasted image 20240721004037.png]]

// After configuring the other other interfaces

![[Pasted image 20240721004117.png]]

**Good practice dictates that unused ports be disabled.** 

While it is convenient to have unused ports be on and ready to go by default, this might cause a lot of problems in bigger networks and be a huge security concern. So, we'll disable these.

# interface range command

From global config mode, enter config-if-range(interface range configuration) mode

		SW1(config)#interface range <interface range>

![[Pasted image 20240721004359.png]]
//All the interfaces in the range don't have to be all consecutive. We can also specify ranges as

		SW1(config)#interface range <interface range 1>, <interface range 2>

![[Pasted image 20240721004828.png]]

Now we can apply the same commands and it works over all the interfaces in the specified range.

![[Pasted image 20240721004637.png]]

we can then use the do sh int status command to see the status of the interfaces. 
![[Pasted image 20240721005304.png]]
(this status is different from the status shown in show ip int brief, which would show the interfaces as administratively down, although practically they mean the same thing.)

# Full / Half Duplex

> Half duplex 
> Device CANNOT receive and send data at the same time. If the device is sending a frame, it 
> cannot receive one.

> Full Duplex:
> Device can receive and send data at the same time.

In modern networks, it is almost always the case that full duplex will be seen, however, sometimes we might run into an older network device like the "HUB", where half duplex works.


# LAN hubs

Around before the switch. Operate at Layer 1.

Much simpler than the switch, is in fact, just a repeater of sorts.

ANY frame that a hub receives, it floods it to every other device on the network.

![[Pasted image 20240721204231.png]]

Now if 2 devices connected on the hub send a frame at the same time, the hub tries to flood BOTH the frames at the same time. This results in a loss of information on the interface, and often, the device will receive no workable, intact frames. 
This is called Collision.

The devices connected to a HUB are in the Collision Domain.

A mechanism called CSMA/CD is used to deal with collisions in a Half duplex situation like this.

# CSMA/CD

Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection

The mechanism details how devices operate in a half duplex situation in such a way, so that collisions can be avoided, and how they deal when collisions DO occur.


1. Before sending frames, devices 'listen' to the collision domain until they detect that other devices are not sending frames.
2. If a collision DOES occur, the device sends a jamming signal to inform the other devices that a collision happened.
3. Each device will wait a random period of time before sending the frames again.

// This process keeps repeating.

This was how Networks operated for a long time before Switches.


# Collision Domains

1. With a hub

![[Pasted image 20240721205509.png]]

2. With a switch

![[Pasted image 20240721205607.png]]
The devices can send data freely with a switch and operate in full duplex.

However, in some very rare cases, collisions can STILL occur with a switch; but more often than not, it is a sign of misconfigurations or some wrong with the network.


# Speed / Duplex Autonegotiation

Interfaces that can run at different speeds 10/100/1000 Mbps , have default settings of speed auto and duplex auto.

Interfaces "advertise" their capabilities to the neighbouring device, and they both negotiate the best possible speed and duplex settings (that they BOTH are capable of).

Ex: A switch negotiating with other devices, and agreeing upon max possible speeds.
![[Pasted image 20240721210430.png]]



In the case that autonegotiation is disabled on a device connected with the switch. 

1. For speed, the switch will try to sense the speed the other device is operating at. If it fails to sense the speed, then the switch will use the slowest speeds it is capable of, on the interface.

2. For duplex, if the speed is 10/100 Mbps, the switch uses half duplex. If the speed is 1000 Mbps or greater, it uses Full duplex.

### Example: Speed and Duplex Assignment Without autonegotiation

# Interface Errors

![[Pasted image 20240721211227.png]]

We shall focus on these statistics shown at the bottom.

![[Pasted image 20240721211308.png]]

// The first line shows the total number of packets received on the interface and the total number of bytes in these packets.

// Runts: Frames smaller than the minimum ethernet frame size of 64 bytes.
// Giants: Frames that are larger than the max ethernet frame size of 1518 bytes

// CRC counter: Frames that failed the CRC check (cyclic redundancy), in the Ethernet FCS (frame check sequence) trailer.

// Frame: Counts frames that have an incorrect format , due to an error.

//Input error counter: Total of various error counters (such as frame, runts, giants, CRC)

// Output errors: Counts Frames the switch tried to send but failed due to an error.

**These counters were shown for a switch here. However, they're the same for a Router.**
