In this lesson, we'll look at how data is sent inside the LAN.

****
# LAN

Local Area Network

A network in a relatively small area

# How data is sent across the LAN


![[Pasted image 20240711043039.png]]

This is an Ethernet frame. (A layer 2 PDU)

## Ethernet Header

Has the following parts:
1. Preamble //not formally considered a part of the header
2. SFD (Start frame delimiter) //not formally considered a part of the header
3. Destination
4. Source
5. Type or Length

// Preamble and SFD

		used for syncing and for preparing the receiving device to receive the rest of the data in the frame

// Destination

		Layer 2 address of the device to which the Frame is being sent

// Source

		Layer 2 address of the device which has sent the frame

// Type or Length

		Indicates the Layer 3 protocol (usually IPv4 or IPv6) used in the encapsulated packet.

		Sometimes, instead of the Type field, it is the Length field, which tells the lengh of the encapsulated data. This depends on the version of ethernet.


## Ethernet Trailer

Has only one field - FCS (Frame Check Sequence)

Used by the receiving device to detect any transmission errors, that might've occured.


****

# Ethernet Header parts in more detail

# Preamble and SFD

Preamble:
1. 7 bytes long (56 bits)
2. Alternating series of bits 10101010 * 7
3. The purpose of this is to allow devices to sync their receiver clocks, so that  they can receive the Data inside correctly.

SFD:
1. 1 byte (8 bits)
2. 10101011
3. Indicates the end of the Preamble and the beginning of the rest of the frame.


# Destination and Source MAC addr

Indicate the devices sending and receiving the frame.

MAC --> Media Access Control (48 bit physical addr)

MAC addr is a 6 byte (48 bit addr) addr of the physical device that is assigned to the device when it is made.

MAC addr is a physical addr, unlike IP addr, which is a logical one.


# Type or Length Field

 2 byte field. (16 bits)

A value of LESS than or equal to 1500 in this field indicates the LENGTH of the frame content in BYTES.

A value of 1536 or greater indicates the TYPE (usually ipv4 or ipv6) , and the length is determined via other methods. More on this later. 

For ex: IPv4 is 0x0800 in Hex. --> 2048 in decimal.

IPv6 is 0x86DD --> 34525 in decimal

# Ethernet Trailer Parts in more detail

# FCS

Frame Check Sequence

4 bytes --> 32 bits in length

Detects corrupted data by running a CRC algorithm over the received data. 

CRC --> Cyclic Redundancy Check


# Sizes/ Lengths of each frame part and the entire frame

### Minimum payload size
![[Pasted image 20240715233753.png]]

If the payload is less than 46 bytes, padding bytes are added to the payload to make it reach 46. 

****

# MAC Addr

A 6 byte physical address assigned to the device when it is made.

AKA BIA --> Burned in Addr

Mac addr is supposed to be globally unique. (in most cases)

The first 3 bytes (first half) of the MAC addr are the OUI (Organisationally Unique Identifier), which is assigned to the company making the device.

The second half (next 3 bytes) are unique to the device itself.

Usually written as a series of 12 Hexadecimal characters.

![[Pasted image 20240711082738.png]]

//The MAC addresses are written as hex digits.
The first half is the same for all MAC addr here, and it indicates that the maker of these devices is the same.

//The Fo ethernet means Fast Ethernet (upto 100mbps speeds)

> Unicast Frame :
> 	A frame intended for just one target.
> More on other frames later.


# Dynamically learned MAC addr / Dynamic MAC addr

When a machine sends a frame to the switch, the switch associates the MAC addr with the port it came from, reading the source info from the frame. This is called a dynamically learned MAC addr because it has not been hard coded onto the switch.


![[Pasted image 20240711083338.png]]

Every switch keeps a MAC addr table like this and fills the table dynamically.

> Unknown Unicast Frame:
> 	A frame for which the switch doesn't have an entry in its MAC addr table. (Doesn't know how to reach it)

In such a case, the switch has only onw option, and that is to FLOOD the frame.

> Flooding:
> 	The switch sends the frame out of all it's interfaces except the one that it received it on.


The device with the matching MAC addr processes the frame up the OSI stack.
The device without the matching dest addr ignore the frame.

However, the device that received the frame correctly must send a reply of some sort so that the switch can populate the MAC addr table correctly, otherwise the comm cannot be dual way.

When it does send a reply, the switch adds it to its MAC addr table.

Now that the switch has both the addr logged, it doesn't need to flood frames.

> Known Unicast Frame:
> 	The switch identifies both the machines' addr.

> Forwarding:
> 	Known unicast frames are sent out only on the associated interfaces. This is known as forwarding.

On CISCO switches, inactive MAC addr are removed from the table after 5 minutes.

Also, it is obvious, but switches use only the SOURCE MAC ADDR field to populate its MAC add table.

# More on ethernet LAN switching

F0 --> Fast ethernet (upto 10 Mbps speeds)
G0 --> Gigabit Ethernet (upto 1 Gbps speeds) 100 times faster


Even when packets are signed with the IP addr, since switches are layer 2 devices, they need to know the devices' MAC addr. 

Since we use IP addr to send traffic over networks instead of the MAC addr, how does a switch associate an IP to a MAC, say in a case like the one shown below?
![[Pasted image 20240716105313.png]]

// The switch is aware of the destination IP, but how does it determine what MAC addr that corresponds to?

This is where ARP comes in.

# ARP

Address Resolution Protocol

Used to discover the Layer 2 addr of a known Layer 3 Addr.

The ARP process consists of 2 processes:

1. ARP req
2. ARP reply


// ARP req --> sent as a broadcast (sent to all devices on a network)

//ARP reply --> Unicast frame (only sent to the host that sent the request)


In practice, it is very similar to the process for a Unknown Unicast frame.

# ARP req frame

![[Pasted image 20240716105923.png]]

FFFF.FFFF.FFFF is the destination MAC addr to be used when a device has to send ethernet frames to all other devices on a network. It is called the broadcast MAC addr.


# ARP table

The table on a device (PCs in our example) that keeps IPs associated to MAC addr.

![[Pasted image 20240716110559.png]]

Command to show arp table on Windows/Linux/MAC:

		arp -a

Command on CISCO IOS (in priv EXEC mode):

		show arp


# GNS3 vs Packet Tracer

GNS3 is a network EMULATOR. 

Packet Tracer is a network SIMULATOR.

GNS3 runs actual cisco IOS software virtually. This also requires you to buy an actual IOS license. 
Since packet tracer is just a sim, it doesn't need a license, but that also makes its functionality rather limited in the real world.

![[Pasted image 20240716111235.png]]


The magnifying glass is a feature in GNS3 that integrates with Wireshark- so we can view the network traffic on the connection. More on this later.

# Ping

A network utility that is used to test reachability / availability.

Measures the round trip time - from PC1 to PC3 back to PC1.

Like ARP, Ping has 2 components:
1. ICMP echo request
2. ICMP echo reply

However the PC does NOT broadcast the ICMP req, that is why, ARP needs to be ran before Pinging.

Command to use ping 

		ping <ip addr to be pinged>


![[Pasted image 20240716112157.png]]

By default, a "ping" command in Cisco IOS sends 5 ICMP echo requests, and we get 5 ICMP echo replies back.

Each ping is 100 bytes. 

. --> Failed ping
! --> Successful

The reason why the fist ping failed is because of ARP. PC1 didn't know the destination MAC addr, so it had to use ARP, and in that time, the first ping failed.

# Wireshark

Allows us to perform "packet capture" to analyse network traffic.

The ping traffic from the last example in wireshark :

# MAC addr Table on a CISCO switch

Commands:

		show mac address-table

// This is the NEW and relevant command in the new Cisco IOS versions.

		show mac-address-table 

// This is the old command, on older devices/ IOS versions


![[Pasted image 20240716113244.png]]

VLAN --> Virtual local area network. The default is 1. more on this later

Ports --> Another Word for Interfaces


> Aging:
> The automatic removal of inactive MAC addr form the MAC addr table of a switch after 5 minutes is aging.

We can also manually remove the MAC addr manually:

		clear mac address-table dynamic

If we do NOT want to remove ALL the MAC addresses, we can specify a certain MAC addr as well:

		clear mac address-table dynamic address <specific addr>


![[Pasted image 20240716113820.png]]


We can also clear MAC addr table entries for a specific interface

		clear mac address-table dynamic interface <interface id>

![[Pasted image 20240716113936.png]]

# Ethernet Frame in Wireshark

![[Pasted image 20240716114116.png]]

The padding zeroes are Hexadecimal zeroes. 

Each hexa decimal digit is 4 bits long.
--> 2 hex digits makes a byte.

Therefore, these 20 zeroes are 10 bytes. --> which makes sense since the 46 byte payload minimum size requirement is to be met.

Again:

1. IPv4 ethernet Type --> 0x0800
2. IPv6 type --> 0x86DD
3. Arp Ethernet type --> 0x0806 (indicates there's an ARP packet inside the frame)
