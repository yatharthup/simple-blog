Command line interface.

Cisco's OS is IOS (different from the apple one, obv)

# How to connect to a cisco device? (Console Port)

![[Pasted image 20240710083208.png]]

You bring your laptop/ pc close to the device and then plug it in.


### What cable to use?

![[Pasted image 20240710083318.png]]

1 end is a RJ45 and the other is a DB9.

Since RJ 45 has only 8 pins, only 8 of the 9 available pins of the DB9 are used.

DB --> D type socket. DataBus 9 pin connector.
#### Pin config for a Rollover cable

Since most modern laptops do not have the port connector as shown in the rollover cable anymore, we might have to use a Port to USB converter connector.

# Accessing the CLI after physical connection 

Putty is a Terminal Emulator and a popular choice.

These are the defaults for CISCO devices, and while what they actually mean is outside the scope of the syllabus, it helps to memorize them.


# The CLI

![[Pasted image 20240710084057.png]]

This is how it typically looks.

# User EXEC mode

Aka User mode.

When we first enter the command line , we enter the User EXEC mode.

> The ">" sign in front of the "Router" is a characteristic of the User Exec mode.

> The "Router" is the default hostname of the device

Very limited

Users can look at *some* things, but CANNOT look at everything and also CANNOT make any changes to the device.

# Privileged EXEC mode

If we enter the "enable" command in user exec mode, we enter the privileged exec mode.

		Router>enable
		Router#

> This "#" sign is indicative of the Priv EXEC mode

1. Complete access to VIEW the device configs. This is NOT the mode in which we can actually change the config.
2. However, some other things can be changed, like the Time on the Device, Saving the current config files, and Restarting the Device.

# Some common Commands available in User EXEC and Priv EXEC mode

![[Pasted image 20240710084839.png]]

These are command screenshots from Cisco Packet tracer (great for the exam, however limited IRL. IRL, there are more commands not shown here.)

> The "?" command can be used to view a list of the available commands on the CLI.

		Router>?
		*lists all the commands here*

		Router#?
		*lists all the commands here*

> The "?" can also be used together to find commands from their initial letter.

		Router>e?
		enable  exit

> The "?" with a space, shows all possible options that can be used after the command (like -r, -g in linux commands or maybe command specific keywords.)

		<cr> 
		*this means there are NO further options for the command*

> Tab autocomplete is available in the CISCO CLI

# Global Configuration Mode

To enter Global Config mode, we enter the "configure terminal" command when in Priv EXEC mode.

		Router#configure terminal
		Router(config)#

> Router(config)# indicates the Global config mode

we can also write conf t, instead.

We exit out of it by "Ctrl + z"

This is where we can change the config of the device.

# Securing the Priv EXEC mode with a password

		Router(config)#enable password


![[Pasted image 20240710091557.png]]

> the "LINE" in all caps means that we type the password in its place and not the word line itself.

**Passwords ARE CASE-SENSITIVE**
3 tries are allowed for Passwords.

> Note: 
> Typing "exit" gets you out of the mode. Global config > Priv > User. Typing exit on user mode logs you out of the device itself.

# Configuration Files on the Device


### running-config / startup-config

There are 2 separate config files on the device.

1. running-config:
	1. Current, active config file on the device
	2. Entering commands in the CLI changes this file.

2. startup-config
	1. config file that will be loaded upon the restart of the device.

The running-config becomes the startup-config upon saving it.

### Viewing the config files

In privileged EXEC mode

		Router#show running-config

OR

		Router#show startup-config


![[Pasted image 20240710093201.png]]


### Saving the config files

There are 3 ways to save the running config to the startup config. 
All 3 commands are executed from the Priv EXEC mode

1. write
2. write memory
3. copy running-config startup-config

# service password-encryption

Encrypts all passwords in a jumble of numbers and/or letters. This helps prevention from storing the password in the clear as plaintext, especially in the config files, which can easily be glanced upon by someone unauthorised.

![[Pasted image 20240710114726.png]]

However the type 7 password encryption (which is a proprietary CISCO algo)

# Enable secret command

		 Router#enable secret Cisco


We can type "do" to run priv EXEC mode commands in other config levels.

		Router(config)#do sh run

shorthand for show running-config.

Enable secret has MD5 encryption, and as a result, we get a number 5 before it on config files.

![[Pasted image 20240710144413.png]]

If both enable-secret and enable-password commands are configured, only enable secret is valid.

The service password-encryption command has no effect on the enable secret command, the enable secret is always encrypted. So, always use enable secret.\

# Cancelling commands

type "no" before commands.
