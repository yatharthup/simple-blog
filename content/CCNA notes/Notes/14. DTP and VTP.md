DTP and VTP are 2 CISCO proprietary protocols.

DTP --> Dynamic Trunking Protocol
VTP --> VLAN Trunking Protocol

Although these have been removed from the exam syllabus, questions about these still show up fairly often.

# DTP (Dynamic trunking Protocol)

Allows switches to negotiate the status of their ports (interface status) to be either trunk or access ports, without manually configuring them.

2 cisco switches connected together can form a trunk, otherwise, the interface will be an access port.

 > DTP is enabled by default on all CISCO switches.
 

*switchport mode access* and *switchport mode trunk* are commands that are not required to be entered when using DTP.

> However, it is recommended for security purposes to manually configure ports and DTP should be DISABLED on all switchports.

Command to DISABLE DTP ON THE SWITCHPORT:

		SW1(config-if)# switchport nonegotiate

//this is dtp here

It further has 2 modes:
1. auto
2. desirable

![[Pasted image 20240814230345.png]]


**Dynamic Desirable**

A switch in dynamic desirable will actively try to form a trunk with and form trunks with other CISCO switches that are in:

1. switchport mode trunk 
2. switchport mode dynamic auto 
3. switchport mode dynamic desirable

To check the config of an interface, use the command:

		SW1# show interfaces g0/0 switchport

**Dynamic Auto**

Switchport doesn't *actively* try to form a trunk, but is willing to form a trunk if the other wants it to.

2 switches both in dynamic auto will form a static access point.

> Note:
> 	Static Access means an access port that belongs to a single VLAN that doesn't change (unless you configure a different VLAN)


![[Pasted image 20240814231817.png]]

DTP will NOT form a trunk with a router or a pc, this is only between switches. For ROAS, it has to be done manually.

##### Trunk encapsulation neg using DTP

Switches that support both 802.1Q and ISL trunk encapsulations can use DTP to negotiate the encapsulation they will use.

This negotiation is *ENABLED* by default, as the default trunk encap mode is *switchport trunk encapsulation negotiate*

In CISCO switches with both ISL and dot1q, ISL is FAVOURED over dot1q if both switches are in negotiate mode.

DTP frames are sent in VLAN1 when using ISL 
In the Native VLAN when using dot1q.
// Although, the *default* native VLAN **is** VLAN1.

# VTP (VLAN trunking protocol)

Allows us to configure VLANs on a central VTP server Switch, and other switches (VTP clients) will synchronise their VLAN database to this server.

Designed for large networks with many VLANs, so that you don't have to manually configure each VLAN on every switch. However, just like DTP, it is NOT RECOMMENDED. MANUAL CONFIG IS RECOMMENDED.

There are 3 versions of VTP 1, 2, 3.
Only Version 3 supports the extended VLAN range.

There are 3 VTP modes:
1. server --> add/modify/delete VLANs
2. client
3. transparent

*server* mode is default for CISCO switches.

##### VTP Servers

Can add/modify/delete VLANs

Store the VLAN database in Non Volatile RAM (this means the VLAN database is saved and persists even if the switch is turned off)

Increases the revision number every time a VLAN is added/modified/deleted.

Will advertise the latest version of the VTP database on trunk interfaces, for VTP clients to sync their database to it.

VTP servers ALSO function as VTP clients, and will sync their database to another VTP server with a higher revision number.

##### VTP clients

Cannot add/modify/delete VLANs.

Do not store the VLAN database in NVRAM (except in version 3, in which they do)

Sync their database to the server with the highest revision number.

Will advertise their Database and forward VTP adverts to other clients over their trunk ports.


## VTP commands

### 1. show vtp status

![[Pasted image 20240815182050.png]]// VTP domain name must be configured for VTP to sync between devices. It is "null" by default.


		SW1(config)# vtp domain <domain_name>
//this changes the domain name 

If a switch with NO DOMAIN NAME/ NULL  DOMAIN NAME receives a VTP advert from another switch with a domain name, it will adopt the domain name of that advert, and automatically joins this domain.


> Here is where a danger of VTP comes into play:
> 	If an old switch with a higher revision  number and the same domain name is connected to the network, all the switches in the domain sync their databases in accordance with this.
> 	This could cause VLANs to disappear and all the end hosts to disconnect.

### 2. vtp mode <mode_name>

		SW1(config)# vtp mode client

![[Pasted image 20240815183109.png]]

### 3. vtp version <version_number>

		SW1(config)# vtp version 2
//changes the vtp version across all devices.
This also counts as an update/revision and will increase the revision count by 1.


##### VTP transparent mode

Does NOT participate in the VTP domain (does NOT sync its database)

Maintains its own DB in NVRAM. It can add/modify/delete VLANs, but they won't be advertised to other switches.

IT STILL WILL FORWARD VTP advertisements in the domain as it is, to the other devices in the domain.


> Changing the vtp domain to an unused domain will reset the revision number to 0.

> Changing the vtp mode to transparent will ALSO reset the revision number to 0.
