# The network we'll use

// Each interface on a network device has a DIFFERENT AND UNIQUE MAC addr.


# The process , step-by-step

1. Pc1 makes an ARP request

	The things in the orange boxes are MAC addr shortened to 4 for clarity.
	![[Pasted image 20240805041851.png]]
	// In the IPv4 header, the Source IP addr comes first
	// In the ethernet MAC header, The Destination MAC addr comes first
	// Since the Destination is ffff.ffff.ffff --> ARP req was a broadcast


2. Router R1 receives and sends back a Unicast ARP reply

	![[Pasted image 20240805042234.png]]
	// The switch learns R1's MAC addr from here as well
	// And Now  PC1 knows the MAC addr of its Default Gateway

3.  PC1 now sends the frame it needs to send to PC4, to the router R1
	![[Pasted image 20240805042501.png]]
	// The original Packet is not changed, its just the Layer 2 part that changes.

4. R1 now looks into its routing table for the next-hop 
	![[Pasted image 20240805042617.png]]
	// R1, therefore, needs to send it out of its Gi0/0 interface (to R2)
	// But R1 does NOT know R2's MAC addr yet, so what does it do?


5. R1 sends out an ARP request
	![[Pasted image 20240805042828.png]]
	//R2 receives this broadcast and since the Dest IP matches, it accepts it

6. R2 sends back a unicast ARP reply
	![[Pasted image 20240805042939.png]]
	//Now R1 has learned R2's MAC addr.

7. Now R1 sends out the packet it had received from pc1 after changing the Layer 2 header accordingly. The frame now looks like:
	![[Pasted image 20240805043132.png]]
	// R2 removes the ethernet header after receiving the frame, and strips it down to the L3 packet (de-encapsulation)

8. Now R2 looks for the matching IP addr in the Dest field in its routing table and determines the adequate next-hop.
	![[Pasted image 20240805043342.png]]

9. R2 doesn't know the MAC addr of R4, and again, the ARP req and reply process takes place and the MAC addr is determined, and the L2 header edited accordingly.
	![[Pasted image 20240805043524.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240805043609.png]]
	![[Pasted image 20240805043621.png]]

10. R4 then receives the frame and strips the layer 2 ethernet header, and looks at the packet's Dest IP in its Routing table.
	![[Pasted image 20240805043744.png]]
	However, again R4 doesn't know PC4's MAC addr yet

11. The ARP req, reply process takes place once again
	![[Pasted image 20240805043857.png]]
	//Switch 4 will learn R4's MAC addr on its Gi0/0 interface, from the source MAC addr field.
	![[Pasted image 20240805044016.png]]
	// Noe that r4 knows PC4's MAC addr, it changes the packet's Ethernet header adequately.

12. R4 sends the frame over to pc4.
	![[Pasted image 20240805044155.png]]
	// Pc4 successfully receives the packet.

13. Now if Pc4 has to send something back to Pc1, all the ARP req steps will be eliminated, because the MAC addr tables are already filled.

> Note:
> 	Switches DO NOT MODIFY layer 2 headers of the frame generally.
