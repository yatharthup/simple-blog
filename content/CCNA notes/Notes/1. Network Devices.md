## Computer Network 

A digital telecom network that allows *Nodes* to share resources.

> Both servers and clients are END hosts in a network

# Network Diagram Symbol

Cloud in a circle --> For the internet (or part of internet which in detail is not relevant to the diagram)
# Client

A device that accesses a service made available by a server

# Server

Device that provides functions/ services for clients.

> **The same device can be a client in some situations and a server in other situations**


# Switch 

A device where the network connections are aggregated.

Used to forward traffic within a LAN.

Switches cannot directly connect to the internet.

Ex:

Catalyst switches are CISCO's enterprise line of switches.

Switch characteristics:
1. Usually 24 + ports
2. Provide connections in a LAN
3. Switches do NOT provide connectivity b/w LANs or over the internet.

# Router

Device used to connect LANs to the internet.

OR

Device to connect and forward traffic b/w multiple networks.

Ex:

Router Characteristics:
1. have fewer network interfaces compared to switches.
2. provide connectivity b/w  LANs or over the internet.

# Firewalls (physical firewalls)

Special network security devices that monitor the traffic flow in and out of our network.

Firewalls can be placed inside or outside the actual LAN, however , the main goal remains the same - to protect the end hosts inside the network.

Usually not designed to connect directly to end hosts, usually designed to connect to switches and routers. it CAN connect 2 networks together even though that is not its intended purpose.

Firewalls have to be configured with security rules.

ASA --> Adaptive Security Firewalls (Cisco's classic firewalls) (Newer versions can also be next gen firewalls)

Firepower --> Cisco's next gen firewall (has built-in IPS {Intrusion prevention system})


# Types of Firewalls 

### 1. Network firewalls 

	Hardware devices that filter traffic b/w networks.
	Also the focus of this course

### 2. Host-based Firewalls

	Software apps that filter traffic entering/exiting a host machine (ex, a pc).

> Even in a network with hardware firewalls , each endpoint should have a host firewall whenever possible.
