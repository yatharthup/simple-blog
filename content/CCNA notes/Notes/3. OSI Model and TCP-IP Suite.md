# Networking Model

Networking Models categorize and provide a structure for networking protocols and standards.

# Network Protocols

A set of LOGICAL (not physical) rules defining how network devices and software should work.


# OSI model

OSI is NOT in use today, but is important because of its impact.

Open Systems Interconnection Model --> OSI 

It is a CONCEPTUAL model that categorizes and standardizes different functions in a network.

Created by ISO in 1980s.

# Application Layer - Layer 7

The layer closest to the end user. 

App layer interacts with software that has some comm component.

ex: HTTP, HTTPS interact with the Browser software.

HTTP HTTPS are Layer 7 protocols.

#### Functions of Layer 7:

1. Identifying comm partners
2. Syncing comm


> *Encapsulation*
> 		the process of additional data being added on to a protocol's original data as it travels down the OSI stack is encapsulation


> *De-encapsulation*
			the stripping away of additions of each layer as the data received is processed through the OSI stack is called de-encapsulation.


## Adjacent Layer and Same Layer Interaction


Both Encapsulation and De-encapsulation are examples of adjacent layer interactions.
![[Pasted image 20240708235423.png]]


However the comm between the application layer of the 2 systems is Same layer interaction.

# Presentation Layer - Layer 6

Data in Layer 7 is in an app specific format, and needs to be translated to a different format to be sent over the network.

The presentation layer (layer 6) translates between these formats, .e, the pplication and the network formats.

### Functions of Layer 6:
1. Encryption of data as it is sent
2. Decryption as it is received
3. Translations b/w different app layer formats as well

# Session Layer - Layer 5

Controls sessions (dialogues) b/w communicating hosts.

Establishes, manages and terminates connections b/w the local app(ex: web browser) and the remote app(ex: youtube on the server)


> Network engineers don't really work with these top 3 layers : 7,6,5 App/ presentation/ session.
> App devs work with these.


**Data prepared over the top 3 layers is packed and sent over to the next 4 for the actual "networking"**.


# Transport Layer - Layer 4

Segments and reassembles data for comm b/w end hosts.

Breaks large pieces of data into smaller more manageable segments that can be sent over the network. In the case of the loss of one (or a few) of these segments, the chances of transmission problems occurring is less. 


Ex: Buffering when loading video content online is waiting for the arrival of such segments. If the entire file were one packet, it wouldn't load at all until the entire video was downloaded.

Also provides host-to-host communication (end to end communication)
Also provides *process to process* communication for apps.


Adds headers to these data segments.

// REVIEW

Data sent over by the top 3 layers. (encapsulated) --> Layer 7,6,5 to Layer 4

If the data is too big, it is broken into parts. --> Layer 4 

Each part + one header is a SEGMENT. --> Layer 4

Segment is transported to Layer 3. --> Layer 4 to Layer 3


# Network Layer - Layer 3

Provides connectivity b/w end hosts on different networks (that is, outside of the LAN)

Provides Logical Addressing (IP addr)

Also Provides Path selection b/w source and destination. (Selecting the best possible path for the information to travel)

*Routers* are Layer 3 devices.

Layer 3 adds on another header that includes info like Source and destination IP addr to the segment. This is now a packet.


![[Pasted image 20240709002352.png]]

This is a packet. ( Segment + L3 header)

# Data Link Layer - Layer 2

Provides node-to-node connectivity and data transfer.

ex: 
1. PC to switch
2. Switch to Router
3. Router to Router
4. Switch to switch

Because this is the layer adjacent to the Physical layer, it also defines how data is formatted for transmission over a physical medium. (ex: For copper UTP cables or for optical fiber)

Also detects(and possibly corrects) Physical layer errors.

The data link layer has its own addressing , different from layer 2 addressing.

Switches are layer 2 devices.


Layer 2 adds both a header and a trailer to the packet it receives from layer 3 (Network layer)
![[Pasted image 20240709002829.png]]
 This is called a frame.

This frame is then sent over the connection (whether its electrical signals over a wire or wireless connection) to the neighbouring system.

REMEMBER, Data is NOT encapsulated further and sent to Layer 1, but transported to the other systems instead.

# Physical Layer - Layer 1

Defines physical characteristics of the transmission medium used to transfer data b/w devices.

ex: 
1. Voltage levels
2. Max transmission distances
3. Physical connectors
4. Cable specs
5. Pin specs and others

Digital bits are converted to electrical signals (for wired connections) or radio signals (for wireless connections)

# OSI Overview

![[Pasted image 20240709004313.png]]

Protocol Data units is simply a general name to refer to all of these. 

Layer 4 PDU is a segment

Layer 5/6/7 PDU is data

Layer 3 PDU is packet

Layer 2 PDU is a frame

Layer 1 PDU is a bit

# TCP/IP suite

Like OSI, a conceptual model that is a set of communication protocols used over the internet and over other networks.

Known as TCP/IP suite because those 2 are the foundational protocols in the suite.

Developed by US DoD through DARPA.

Similar structure to the OSI model but with fewer layers (Layers of OSI are combined into 1 layer here)

THIS is the model that is in use in modern networks.

HOWEVER, STILL WHEN USING LAYER NUMBERING IT REFERS TO THE OSI NUMBER USUALLY.
