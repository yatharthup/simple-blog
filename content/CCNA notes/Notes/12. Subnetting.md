# IPv4 Address Classes

Each class has a few bits pre-set to 0 or 1. This decides how the possible addresses will look.

// However, only class A, B and C addr can be assigned to devices, class D and E have special purposes.

### How are IP addr assigned to companies and corporations?

The IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) is a non-profit American Organisation that assigns IP addr to companies based on their size.

# CIDR (classless Inter-Domain routing)

Created by the IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) to replace the Class Addressing System, to remedy IPv4 Addr running out.

With CIDR, the requirements of Class A , b and C networks having a netmask of /8, /16 and /24 respectively were removed, allowing larger networks to be split into smaller networks.

These smaller networks are subnets.

Now, since the formula for number of usable hosts on a network is 

$$usable\space addresses= 2^{(number\space of\space host\space  bits)} \space - 2 $$

CIDR allows the netmasks to be different, allowing for networks looking like:

// This simply means that we can pre=fix more and more Network bits, and prevent addr wastage.

Now, something like 

203.0.113.0/31 seems like it won't be useful, since it has NO free address bits left.

But for a connection like this (point to point network)

this subnet is actually viable.

Normally this would be a problem, but here, since there is only 1 path and link here, so there is no need for a network/broadcast address. /31 masks are the most valid and efficient ones for POINT TO POINT CONNECTIONS. /30 netmasks are also used for point to point connections sometimes.

/32 masks are used more for specifying routes to a specific hosts, and NOT in network subnetting.

A quick method to remember how to have enough subnets, is to write the network address in terms of bits, and then to borrow sufficient bits $2^{bit \space number}$ . When this is equal to or greater than the desired number of subnets, we assign the relevant netmask and work from there.

Here, then, the netmask is /23.

# Some Tables of Subnets According to Class

These are good for reference, but you do not need to memorize these word for word. Look at them often and you'll start making the associations.

> However, remember, that the process of subnetting Class A, B and C networks are ALL EXACTLY THE SAME.

##### Class C

#### Class B

#### Class A

# VLSM
Variable Length Subnet Masks

Until now we've seen FLSMs (Fixed length subnet masks). --> All the subnets use the same netmask length.

VLSM is the process of creating subnets of different sizes according to the requirements of the network.

![[Pasted image 20240809092659.png]]


#### Steps to subnet using VLSM

1. Assign the largest subnet at the start of the address space.
2. Then assign the second largest and so on, until all the subnets have been assigned.

> Note:
> For the CCNA, use /30 for point to point connections, even though irl, we'd use /31.
