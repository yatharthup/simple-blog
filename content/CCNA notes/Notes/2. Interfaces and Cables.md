RJ --> Registered Jacks

The common ethernet cable is the RJ-45 cable, and the port is the RJ45 port

# Ethernet

A collection of network protocols/standards

Internet speed is measured in BITS per second and NOT bytes per second, because information is transferred along the cables one bit at a time, and not as a whole byte.

A BYTE per second is 8 times larger than a BIT per second.

# Ethernet Standards

Defined in IEEE 802.3 from 1983

![[Pasted image 20240704223029.png]]

Base --> Baseband cabling (outside the scope of CCNA but look it up)
T --> Twisted pair (more on it soon)

# UTP cables

Copper cables used in Ethernet Standards.

4 pairs (8 wires)

![[Pasted image 20240704223313.png]]

Unshielded --> Makes them vuln to electronic interference (EMI)

The twist helps to protect against EMI

RJ 45 port has 8 pins, then 
However, not every standard uses all 8 pins.

10 BaseT 100 BaseT (10 and 100 Mbps) --> Use 4 pins (2 pairs)

1000 BaseT 10GBaseT --> Use 8 pins (all 4 pairs)

# How the pins are connected

Tx --> Data transmission pins

Rx --> Data receival pins

> REMEMBER :
> 	The first 2 pins of a pc / server / Router / Firewall TRANSMIT data , whereas the first 2 pins of a switch are Rx.


# Cable Types (Acc to Pin connection) 

### Straight-through Cable

Pin 1 on one side of the cable (1st connector) connects to Pin 1 on the other side (2nd connector) 
### Crossover Cable

Pin 1 on one side connects to Pin 3 on the other
Pin 2 to Pin 6
pin 3 to pin 1
pin 6 to pin 2


# UTP Cabling 10BaseT / 100BaseT

Allows for Full duplex Transmission , i.e. , both devices can Transmit and recieve data at the same time.

1, 2, 3 and 6 pin are used.

#### PC/server with Switch

Straight-through cables are used

#### Router with Switch

Router pins are similar to PC

Straight-through cables are used.

### Router with router 

Crossover cable is used

> Similarly Switch with switch/ PC with router/ PC with PC , crossover cables are used.


# Auto MDI-X 

Automatic Medium Dependent Interface Crossover

This is a feature built into all modern network devices. It detects the pin type being used by the other device and adjusts which pins it itself uses to transmit /receive data, ensuring no problems despite the cabling being used.

However knowing about straight-through and crossover cables is good when working with older networking equipment.



# UTP Cabling 1000BaseT / 10GBaseT

![[Pasted image 20240704234350.png]]

In 1000 Base T each connection is also BIDIRECTIONAL , so, it isn't limited to just transmitting or just receiving data.

# Fiber Optic Connections

 Use SFP(Small Form-Factor Pluggable) Transceiver ports and Fiber Optic Cables instead of RJ45s.

The connectors on each end of the fiber optic cable is to transmit and receive data each. Uses light instead of copper wires.

# Components of a Fiber Optic Cable

![[Pasted image 20240705000149.png]]

There are 2 kinds of Fiber Optic Cables:
1. Single mode fiber optic cable
2. Multimode Fiber Optic Cable


# Multimode Fiber Cable

1. Core diameter is wider than single-mode fiber cable
2. Cheaper than Single mode : Due to cheaper LED based SFP transmitters
3. Allows multiple angles (modes) of light waves to enter the fiberglass core
4.  Allows for cables LONGER than UTP, but shorter than single mode fiber

![[Pasted image 20240705003203.png]]


# Single Mode Fiber

1. Core diameter is narrower than multi mode
2. Light enters at a single angle (mode) from a Laser Based Transmitter.
3. More expensive than mutlimode due to this thinner glass core and Laser Based Transmitters.
4. Allows longer cables than both multimode and UTP.

# Fiber Optic Cable Standards

![[Pasted image 20240705004246.png]]

SR/LR/ER -->Short Range/ Long Range/ Extended Range

SX/LX --> Short Wavelength / Long Wavelength Extended

# SECURITY RISK WITH UTP CABLES

UTP cables emit/leak a faint signal OUTSIDE of the cable, which can be copied (this is a security risk)

> However, remember, most switches do NOT have enough SFP ports normally, and in closed and protected premise environments with many connections, UTP are still used and preferred.
