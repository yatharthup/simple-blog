In contrast to Static Routing (with ip route command).

If a new LAN is added, the router automatically tells the others , and the network adjusts accordingly.

// this is the topology we're using.

![[Pasted image 20240818001429.png]]
// these are examples of network routes (a route with a mask length less than /32 and is a route to a network/subnet)

// Host route (/32 mask), connects to a specific host.

Upon enabling a dynamic routing protocol on a connection, the router will advertise information about the routes they know to other routers.

![[Pasted image 20240818001641.png]]

// if an error occurs and R4's connection goes down, the other routers will automatically adapt and remove it from their rotuing tables. This will prevent traffic being sent to a dead end, and the other routers are unaware.

> In dynamic routing, dead ends are removed, and if a better path is available, the traffic is switched to there.


Example: In this config, the route b/w R2 and R4 is dropped and replaced by another.

Routers form "adjacencies" / "neighbour relationships" / " neighborships" with adjacent routers to exchange advertisement info.

If multiple routes are learned, the router determines which route is "superior" (by the lower metric) and this superior route is added to the routing table. (just like root cost in STP)

## Types of Dynamic routing Protocols


DRPs can be of 2 types:
1. IGP (interior gateway protocol)
2. EGP (exterior gateway protocol)

IGP --> Used to share routes within a Single *autonomous system* which is a single organisation.

EGP --> b/w diff autonomous systems (AS)

![[Pasted image 20240818002606.png]]

// OSPF is an IGP.

These categories can be broken down acc to Algorithm type. (Algorithms in this context are the processes that each protocol uses to select the best paths.)

![[Pasted image 20240818002833.png]]

// OSPF which is the Link State IGP is the most important here.

// RIP and EIGRP is a Distance Vector one.

# Distance Vector Protocols

Invented before Link State Protocols

These protocols operate by sending the following to their DIRECTLY CONNECTED neighbours:
1. known destination networks
2. their metric to reach these known destination networks.

// This method of sharing info is also known as "routing by rumour", because the router only knows the info that its neighbours tell it, and does not know the network beyond that.

![[Pasted image 20240818003237.png]]

// Basically distance vector protocols work by devices sharing their routing tables (or parts of it) with their neighbours.


![[Pasted image 20240818003330.png]]// Each routing protocol uses a different metric and associated numbers, this is just a generalisation. More on the metrics later.

![[Pasted image 20240818003413.png]]

# Link State Routing Protocols

Each router constructs a "connectivity map" of the network.

Each router advertises information about its interfaces and connected networks to its neighbours. 
These adverts are passed along to other devices, until each router develops the same map of the network.

Each router then INDEPENDENTLY calculates the best routes to each destination for itself.


Obviously, these protocols use more resources on the router, due to the info passed and processed.
The trade-off is that they are much faster than distance vector protocols in reacting to the changes in networks.


Examples:
1. OSPF
2. IS-IS intermediate system to system


### How does a router using a Dynamic Routing Protocol determine the best route to be added to the routing table?

It uses the metric value. 
The lower the metric value, the better the route.

> If 2 routes have the exact same metric, to the same destination, both will be added to the routing table, and load will be balanced over them.


![[Pasted image 20240818004136.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240818004120.png]]
// this is called EQUAL COST MULTI PATH (ECMP) load balancing.
ECMP can work with equal static routes as well.

110/3 --> Here 110 is Administrative distance (more on this later)
3 is the metric

For static routes, there is NO metric, so metric will be 0 always.

# Metric Summary

Details later.

### A small demo of how a difference in metrics determines the route

![[Pasted image 20240818004841.png]]
// Both routes will be put into R1's route table (for RIP). Even though the route through r3 is SLOWER, it doesn't matter when using RIP, because it doesn't consider bandwidth.

// OSPF will only enter one route into the route table, because it considers the bandwidth as a metric.


# Administrative Distance

In most cases, a company will only use one IGP for its network.

However, in some rare cases, it might use 2 different Routing Protocols.

Here then, Administrative Distance helps , since METRIC IS PROTOCOL SPECIFIC AND CANNOT BE USED HERE.

Admin Dist is used to determine which routing protocol is preferred.

> The lower the Administrative Distance of the protocol, the more trustworthy and better it is, and preferred.

![[Pasted image 20240818005159.png]]


# Protocol Admin Preference comp

> Directly connected routes > Static > eBGP > EIGRP > IGRP > OSPF > ISIS > RIP > EIGRP ext > iBGP > Unusable route

![[Pasted image 20240818005507.png]]

> The AD of a routing protocol can be changed, configuring the AD of a protocol on a router, so that it is preferred over another.


# IMPORTANT
METRIC FIELD IN A STATIC ROUTE IS *DIFFERENT* FROM THE DYNAMIC ROUTING METRIC. 
**METRIC FIELD IN STATIC ROUTES IS SIMPLY THE ADMIN DISTANCE.**

![[Pasted image 20240818005823.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240818005844.png]]
// Here the AD of the static route was changed to higher than that of the dynamic routing protocol's (which is 90 in this case.), so that the dynamic routing protocol's route is preferred over it.

This is called a *floating static route*. 
They'll not be in the routing table / will be inactive, until the route learnt by the Dynamic Routing protocol is removed.
