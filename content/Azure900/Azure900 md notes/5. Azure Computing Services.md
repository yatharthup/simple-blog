Azure offers a few Computing services:
1. VMs
2.  Azure Container Instances
3. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)
4. Azure Service Fabric
5. Azure Batch
6. Azure Functions

# Azure Virtual Machines 

The most common type of compute used.

Hardware is shared with other customers.
OS/Memory/CPU/Storage config available.

Highly Configurable server that allows the client to run a server WITHOUT the physical handling. Everything else is on the client.

Also, we can attach multiple managed Disks to the azure machine.

## What happens when an Azure VM is launched

When you *launch* an Azure VM, other networking components will be either created OR associated with the VM.

![[Pasted image 20240824130929.png]]

// This is the list that Azure gives, of it creating services when a VM is launched.
(Sometimes, Azure will also put them in a resource group for the user, so that they all run together.)

It might be structured something like:

![[Pasted image 20240824132528.png]]

## Azure VM Operating Systems

Decided by the image the client chooses for the VM. (most of these Azure machine optimised images can be found on the **Azure Marketplace**) 

We can also bring our own images by creating a VHD (Linux Virtual Hard Disk).
// Only Fixed VHD, Hyper-V VHD (VHDX) is NOT supported in Azure.

Some partnered OS's are:

## Azure Scale Sets

Azure Scale Sets allows the client to automatically *increase/decrease* VM capacity.

(Horizontal Scaling)

### Load Balancer

Can be associated with a Scale Set.

Evenly distribute you VMs across multiple AZs to make the application HA (Highly Available.)

Also, **Load balancer probe checks** are much more robust health checks than what Scale sets offer.

![[Pasted image 20240825084338.png]]
2 Different Load balancers:
1. **Application Gateway :** An HTTP/HTTPS web traffic load balance with URL-based routing, SSL termination, Session Persistence, and web app firewall.
2. **Azure Load Balancer :** Supports all TCP/UDP network traffic, port-forwarding, outbound flows.


### Scaling Policy

Scaling policies determine when a VM should be added or removed (to meet the requirements.)

![[Pasted image 20240825084726.png]]
// This is the options available DURING creation.
// When you are creating a scaled set , you have VERY LIMITED options for your scaling policy.

Once the scaled set is created successfully the options increase tremendously.

If you want more metrics, there are 2 ways:

1. **App Insights:** Installs a small instrumentation package in your application that monitors the app and sends telemetry to Azure. (Ex of metrics it provides: Page Load Performance, Session Counts)
2. **Azure Diagnostics Extension :** An Agent that runs INSIDE A VM instance. Monitors and saves performance metrics to Azure Storage for more detailed Host-basic metrics/info.

*Some more Scale set policies, not in the form, but still available around the interface in Azure:*

### Health Monitoring

Can be enabled to determine if your server (VM instance) is healthy or unhealthy.

There are 2 modes:

1. Application Health Extension : Pings HTTP req with a specific path and expect 200.
2. Load Balancer Probe: More robust, but works only when you have an associated Load Balancer. Checks based on TCP/UDP/HTTP req.

![[Pasted image 20240825090014.png]]

**Automatic Repair Policy:** If an instance is found unhealthy, and this option is tuned on, it automatically deletes it after a grace period.

# Azure Container Instances

Essentially Docker as a Service.

Run containerised apps on Azure without provisioning a specific server or VM.

# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Similar to ACI, Kubernetes as a service.

Another way of working with Containers, uses the OpenSource K8 Kubernetes Software.

Become the de-facto for containers

# Azure Service Fabric

> Tier 1 Enterprise Containers as a Service

It is a Distributed Systems Platform, that runs in Azure or on-premises.

Easy to package, deploy, and manage scalable and reliable *microservices.*

> *Containers:*
> A **container** is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers ensure that software runs consistently across different environments.
> *Microservices:*
> An even smaller unit than containers, and is rather a fragmentation of the entire application. A **microservice** is an architectural style where an application is composed of loosely coupled, small, and independent services. Each microservice focuses on a specific business function or capability and communicates with other services through APIs.


# Azure Functions

Event driven functions (serverless compute) that run code without provisioning or managing servers.

It's a platform for executing small pieces of code (functions) in response to triggers such as HTTP requests, timer events, or messages from a queue.

**Use Cases:**

- **Simple Tasks:** Ideal for tasks like processing data from a queue, running scheduled jobs, or handling webhooks.
- **Microservice Functions:** Can be used to implement small microservice components, especially when the tasks are event-driven or have varying workloads.


Payment only for the compute time consumed.

# Azure Batch

Plan, schedule and execute the client's batch computer workloads across VMs, running 100+ jobs in parallel.

Use Spot VMs to save money (low priority VMs that save on compute power)

 ****

# Azure Virtual Desktop

> A desktop and app virtualisation service that runs on the cloud.

Works across most OS devices, and most modern web browsers can access Azure Virtual Desktop Apps.

Especially useful when data security is a concern, as here, nothing is left to the user and everything is stored on the cloud.
