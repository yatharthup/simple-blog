# Regions and Geographies for Azure

**Region** :
	Grouping of multiple Datacentres (AZs).

Azure has 58 regions in 140 countries.

**Geographies** : 
	Discreet market of 2 or more regions that preserves *data residency* and *compliance boundaries.*

// In essence, if you want for any reason whatsoever that your data doesn't leave a certain country/group of counties, as an example, you do NOT want your data on US soil, you can choose a Geography that limits it.

Some common Azure geography examples are:
1. US
2. Azure Government (US)
3. Canada
4. Brazil
5. Mexico

Generally, how *Regions* work in Azure are:
> When the client wants to launch a resource, they choose a region and a virtual machine.

# Paired Regions

Each region is paired with ANOTHER region around 300 miles (482 kms) away. 
These are synced, and ONLY ONE REGION is updated at a time, to ensure that no availability outages take place.

Some Azure Services rely on Paired Regions for DR (Disaster Recovery).

**Ex: Azure Geo-Redundant Storage (GRS)**

Replicates data to a secondary region *automatically*, ensuring that data is durable even in the event of the primary region failing.

# Region Types and Service Availability


> Not all Azure Services are available in *every* region. (Infrastructure limitations, Government Policy limitations, Compliance Reason)

So, Azure has 2 Region Types:

1. **Recommended Regions** --> Provide the Broadest range of Service Capabilities. Designed to support. Designed to support multiple AZs for robust DR and HA.

2. **Alternate (Other) Regions** --> Expand Azure's Footprint within data residency boundaries where a recommended region *ALSO* exists. However, these have limited capabilities due to lack of multiple AZ presence, and should be used for low priority operations, and if there is virtually no other option left.

> **General Availability (GA)** --> When a service is considered ready to be made public/ available to everyone. Transitioning out of *Beta testing* but before *production level* in a sense.


Azure's Services based on *Availability* are grouped into 3 categories:

1. **Foundational** : When declared GA, a *foundational* cloud service is made available IMMEDIATELY OR IN 12 MONTHS time in Recommended and Alternate Regions. *Ex: AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) provides basic cloud computation services.*

2. **Mainstream** : When declared GA, a *mainstream* Cloud service becomes available IMMEDIATELY OR IN 12 MONTHS time in *Recommended Regions*. Availability in Alternate Regions depends on Customer Demand. *Ex: Google's GSuite*

3. **Specialised** : Made available in both Recommended and Alternate Regions based on Customer Demand. *Ex: IBM's WATSON AI model*

# Special Regions

Azure has specialised regions to meet compliance or legal reasons. Often in collaboration with Governments.

**Ex1:** 3 Disclosed Azure Government Regions in US are:
	1. US DoD Central
	2. US Gov Virginia
	3. US Gov Iowa

**Ex2:** Microsoft + 21vianet (in-partnership) disclosed Government Regions in China:
	1. China East
	2. China North

# Availability Zones (AZs)

> An *Availability Zone* is a PHYSICAL LOCATION made up of *one or more* Datacentres.

Also, 
		 AZ == Fault Domain + Update Domain
// more on this in a bit.

A *Region* will generally have 3 AZs. For HA (High Availability)

AZs in a region will be isolated from each other, but still close enough to provide minimal latency.

// A simplified version of how to select AZs.

**List of Azure Regions that HAVE a minimum of 3 AZs:**
1. Central US
2. East US 2
3. West US 2
4. West Europe
5. France Central
6. North Europe
7. Southeast Asia

# Fault and Update Domains

As mentioned before, an Availability Zone in Azure is a combination of a Fault Domain and an Update Domain.

## Fault Domain
A logical grouping of hardware to avoid a single point of failure within an Availability Zone.

Basically, a group of VMs that share a Common Power Source and Network Switch.

This helps with preventing other servers from going down even if part of the datacentre fails.

## Update Domain
No two domains will be updated at the exact same time, and this allows workload shifting to the Update Domain, while the primary one is updated, and vice-versa, preventing the services from going offline and ensuring HA.


## Availability Sets

A logical grouping in Azure that can be used to ensure that the VMs placed in ON AVAILABILITY SET are in different fault/update domains to avoid downtime.
