**From ChatGPT:**
	A CSV file stands for "Comma-Separated Values." It’s a type of text file used to store tabular data, like a spreadsheet or a database. Each line in the file represents a row of data, and within each line, individual values are separated by commas.

For example, a simple CSV file might look like this:


		Name, Age, City 
		Alice, 30, New York 
		Bob, 25, Los Angeles
		Charlie, 35, Chicago 

Here’s a breakdown:

- The first line is the header row, which describes the data in each column.
- Each subsequent line represents a record (or row) with fields (or columns) separated by commas.

CSV files are widely used because they’re easy to create and read, and they can be opened by many different programs, including spreadsheet software like Excel and Google Sheets.
