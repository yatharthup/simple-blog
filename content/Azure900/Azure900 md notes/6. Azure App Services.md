> Platform as a Service

Allows quick deployment and management of Web Apps on Azure without having to worry about the underlying infrastructure.

**Azure App Service** is a HTTP based services for hosting web apps, REST APIs and mobile backends.

2. Heroku equivalent in Azure

# Runtimes

Runtime is software/instructions that are executed *while* your program is running.

Generally means what languages, libs and frameworks you're using.

> A runtime for Azure App Services would be a **pre-defined container** that has your language and commonly used libs for that language installed.

// They also provide multiple versions of a specific runtime, although, latest versions are preferred.

# Custom Containers

Allows you to push your own custom containers to Azure (with runtimes not available on Azure App Services). (Again, custom defined containers for Windows/ Linux)

# Deployment Slots

> Allow you to create Different Environments of your web app, associated to a different hostname.

Useful when a staging or QA env is needed.

Environments can be swapped (blue/green deployment)

//Think of it as a way to quickly clone the production env for other users.


# App Service Environments

App Service Environment (ASE) is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running App Service apps at a high scale.

#### External ASE

Called an External ASE because it exposes the ASE-hosted apps on an internet-accessible IP addr.

#### ILB ASE

ILB ASE exposes the ASE hosted apps on an IP addr inside your VNet. Nothing is exposed to the public internet(only accessible through org VNets or peer VNets), so it is more secure.

The internal endpoint is an Internal Load balancer ILB.
