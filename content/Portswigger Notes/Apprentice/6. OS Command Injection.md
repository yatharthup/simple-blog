AKA Shell Injection. Allows the attacker to execute OS commands on the server.

## Useful commands

After you identify an OS command injection vulnerability, it's useful to execute some initial commands to obtain information about the system. Below is a summary of some commands that are useful on Linux and Windows platforms:

| Purpose of command    | Linux         | Windows         |
| --------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Name of current user  | `whoami`      | `whoami`        |
| Operating system      | `uname -a`    | `ver`           |
| Network configuration | `ifconfig`    | `ipconfig /all` |
| Network connections   | `netstat -an` | `netstat -an`   |
| Running processes     | `ps -ef`      | `tasklist`      |

## Injecting OS commands

In this example, a shopping application lets the user view whether an item is in stock in a particular store. This information is accessed via a URL:

`https://insecure-website.com/stockStatus?productID=381&storeID=29`

To provide the stock information, the application must query various legacy systems. For historical reasons, the functionality is implemented by calling out to a shell command with the product and store IDs as arguments:

`stockreport.pl 381 29`

This command outputs the stock status for the specified item, which is returned to the user.

I think we can simple change the command in the arguments. Or add an extra command using ";"

Something like 

`https://insecure-website.com/stockStatus?productID=381&storeID=29;uname -a`

The & character and | character is also a command separator in shells.

Don't forget to make changes to the POST requests and not the GET ones.
