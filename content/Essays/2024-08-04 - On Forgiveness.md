At the end of the day, all of us have our faults, our strengths and our moments of weaknesses.

The more I look inward, the more I see that the ugly and the virtuous are not 2 corners of the psyche, nor are they 2 boxes, but rather its all a grey fluid, the two mushing together, swirling patterns in the same state.
As the swirls turn and swell, so do I. I change, continuously, change cannot be avoided. However, it is consistent positive change that is desirable. 
Still, I oscillate with an enormous amplitude, oftentimes doing a 180 on my thoughts in a matter of minutes. 
As I examine this in myself, I see the overall picture being a positive one. Why then do I forget to do the same for others sometimes and take offense at what they do? Hold grudges and construct these fragile notions of respectful conduct, and expect others to follow it, instead of adhering to it silently and honourably in solace? 
We're all cut from the same cosmic cloth, or something close to it.

What it then means is that, I must look at the conduct of others similarly. A friend that might've upset me with their conduct, a member of the family, or a rude stranger; they might just be having a moment of weakness, and most likely that is not their true nature. For the most part most people are, as long as they are not inherently completely evil, they are human. And why must thou hate thy kindred , moulded in the same flesh, cut of the same cloth, partaking of the same breath, for their weak moments, for their moments of error?

Think of all the good they've done unto you, and let go, forgive, not just because it helps you and mends relations but because it is thine responsibility to make sacred all that is natural, and be affected not by what is borne of nature, what what is of nature, is how things are. Above good and bad, they are natural. And a good man respects and recognises this, and tries his best to be devout to this nature, that makes everything the way it is.

So, forgive, truly and not just to be the bigger person.

> Forgive, for it is good, both to the other and to you. Forgive, for that is sacred to nature. Forgive, because forgiveness constitutes kindness and kindness is strength. Be a strong man, an adherent of nature, and as a result, of all things natural.


Stay strong brother.
