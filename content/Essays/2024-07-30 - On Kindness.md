Recently, I've been feeling rage, intense rage, bursts of anger. And it does not feel good to me. 

I started training boxing and martial arts to make myself stronger, fuller, not angrier, fragile to touch, easily roused.

I think it goes against the tenets of being a martial artist, and a strong person, to be swayed by emotions, especially anger. Be competent, yes, but never be trigger happy.

I think today's thought to think about must then be:

> The act of rage is not the sign of strong man. Kindness is true strength. Be kind.

// What then is Kindness? 

I feel that kindness isn't being subservient, but kindness is doing the right thing, regardless of how it makes you feel. 

If you feel the urge to talk back angrily to someone, kindness is explaining yourself calmly. 
If you someone does something wrong unto you, kindness isn't accepting it and letting yourself be beat down. However kindness isn't getting angry about it either. Kindness is letting them know that what they did was wrong, patiently, calmly.
Kindness isn't separated from decisiveness, it isn't separated from taking hard decisions, or from severing ties, or being uncompromising with your morals, kindness is doing all of them, when it is required of you. Kindness is rising up to the responsibility, kindness is staying true to yourself, kindness is realising your full potential and giving back.
Kindness IS strength.
